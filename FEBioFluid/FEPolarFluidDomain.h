//! Abstract interface class for polar fluid domains.

//! A polar fluid domain is used by the polar fluid mechanics solver.
//! This interface defines the functions that have to be implemented by a
//! polar fluid domain. There are basically two categories: residual functions
//! that contribute to the global residual vector. And stiffness matrix
//! function that calculate contributions to the global stiffness matrix.
