@article{Mullender94,
	abstract = {Although the capacity of bone to adapt to functional mechanical requirements has been known for more than a century, it is still unclear how the bone adaptation processes are regulated. We hypothesize that osteocytes are sensitive to mechanical loading and control the regulation of bone mass in their environment. Recently, simulation models of such a process were developed, using the finite element method. It was discovered that these models produce discontinuous structures, not unlike trabecular bone. However, it was also found that severe discontinuities violate the continuum assumption underlying the finite element method and that the solutions were element mesh dependent. We have developed a simulation model (which is physiologically and mechanically more consistent) which maintains the self-organizational characteristics but does not produce these discontinuities. This was accomplished by separating the sensor density and range of action from the mesh. The results clearly show that predicted trabecular morphology, i.e. sizes and branching of struts, depend on the actual relationship between local load, sensor density and range of influence. We believe that the model is suitable to study the relationship between trabecular morphology and load and can also explain adaptation of morphology, in the sense of 'Wolff's law'.},

@article{Ateshian23b,
	abstract = {This study examines the theoretical foundations for the damage mechanics of biological tissues in relation to viscoelasticity. Its primary goal is to provide a mechanistic understanding of well-known experimental observations in biomechanics, which show that the ultimate tensile strength of viscoelastic biological tissues typically increases with increasing strain rate. The basic premise of this framework is that tissue damage occurs when strong bonds, such as covalent bonds in the solid matrix of a biological tissue, break in response to loading. This type of failure is described as elastic damage, under the idealizing assumption that strong bonds behave elastically. Viscoelasticity arises from three types of dissipative mechanisms: (1) Friction between molecules of the same species, which is represented by the tissue viscosity. (2) Friction between fluid and solid constituents of a porous medium, which is represented by the tissue hydraulic permeability. (3) Dissipative reactions arising from weak bonds breaking in response to loading, and reforming in a stress-free state, such as hydrogen bonds and other weak electrostatic bonds. When a viscoelastic tissue is subjected to loading, some of that load may be temporarily supported by those frictional and weak bond forces, reducing the amount of load supported by elastic strong bonds and thus, the extent of elastic damage sustained by those bonds. This protective effect depends on the characteristic time response of viscoelastic mechanisms in relation to the loading history. This study formalizes these concepts by presenting general equations that can model the damage mechanics of viscoelastic tissues.},

	abstract = {This work formulates frictionless contact between solid bodies in terms of a repulsive potential energy term and illustrates how numerical integration of the resulting forces is computationally similar to the ``pinball algorithm'' proposed and studied by Belytschko and collaborators in the 1990s. We thereby arrive at a numerical approach that has both the theoretical advantages of a potential-based formulation and the algorithmic simplicity, computational efficiency, and geometrical versatility of pinball contact. The singular nature of the contact potential requires a specialized nonlinear solver and an adaptive time stepping scheme to ensure reliable convergence of implicit dynamic calculations. We illustrate the effectiveness of this numerical method by simulating several benchmark problems and the structural mechanics of the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) heart valve. Atrioventricular valve closure involves contact between every combination of shell surfaces, edges of shells, and cables, but our formulation handles all contact scenarios in a unified manner. We take advantage of this versatility to demonstrate the effects of chordal rupture on tricuspid valve coaptation behavior.},

@article{Shim23,
	abstract = {The objective of this study was to implement a novel fluid-solutes solver into the open-source finite element software FEBio, that extended available modeling capabilities for biological fluids and fluid-solute mixtures. Using a reactive mixture framework, this solver accommodates diffusion, convection, chemical reactions, electrical charge effects, and external body forces, without requiring stabilization methods that were deemed necessary in previous computational implementations of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation at high Peclet numbers. Verification and validation problems demonstrated the ability of this solver to produce solutions for Peclet numbers as high as 1e11, spanning the range of physiological conditions for convection-dominated solute transport. This outcome was facilitated by the use of a formulation that accommodates realistic values for solvent compressibility, and by expressing the solute mass balance such that it properly captured convective transport by the solvent and produced a natural boundary condition of zero diffusive solute flux at outflow boundaries. Since this numerical scheme was not necessarily foolproof, guidelines were included to achieve better outcomes that minimize or eliminate the potential occurrence of numerical artifacts. The fluid-solutes solver presented in this study represents an important and novel advancement in the modeling capabilities for biomechanics and biophysics as it allows modeling of mechanobiological processes via the incorporation of chemical reactions involving neutral or charged solutes within dynamic fluid flow. The incorporation of charged solutes in a reactive framework represents a significant novelty of this solver. This framework also applies to a broader range of non-biological applications.},

@article{Menzel12,
	abstract = {Unlike common engineering materials, living matter can autonomously respond to environmental changes. Living structures can grow stronger, weaker, larger, or smaller within months, weeks, or days as a result of a continuous microstructural turnover and renewal. Hard tissues can adapt by increasing their density and grow strong. Soft tissues can adapt by increasing their volume and grow large. For more than three decades, the mechanics community has actively contributed to understand the phenomena of growth and remodeling from a mechanistic point of view. However, to date, there is no single, unified characterization of growth, which is equally accepted by all scientists in the field. Here we shed light on the continuum modeling of growth and remodeling of living matter, and give a comprehensive overview of historical developments and trends. We provide a state-of-the-art review of current research highlights, and discuss challenges and potential future directions. Using the example of volumetric growth, we illustrate how we can establish and utilize growth theories to characterize the functional adaptation of soft living matter. We anticipate this review to be the starting point for critical discussions and future research in growth and remodeling, with a potential impact on life science and medicine.},

@article{Rodriguez94,
	abstract = {Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in soft elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stress-dependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},

@article{Ateshian23,
	abstract = {Reactive viscoelasticity is a theoretical framework based on the theory of reactive constrained mixtures that encompasses nonlinear viscoelastic responses. It models a viscoelastic solid as a mixture of strong and weak bonds that maintain the cohesiveness of the molecular constituents of the solid matter. Strong bonds impart the elastic response while weak bonds break and reform into a stress-free state in response to loading. The process of bonds breaking and reforming is modeled as a reaction where loaded bonds are the reactants and bonds reformed into a stress-free state are the products of a reaction. The reaction is triggered by the evolving state of loading. The state of stress in strong bonds is a function of the total strain in the material, whereas the state of stress in weak bonds is based on the state of strain relative to the time that these bonds were reformed. This study introduces two important practical contributions to the reactive nonlinear viscoelasticity framework: (1) normally, the evaluation of the stress tensor involves taking a summation over a continually increasing number of weak bond generations, which is poorly suited for a computational scheme. Therefore, this study presents an effective numerical scheme for evaluating the strain energy density, the Cauchy stress, and spatial elasticity tensors of reactive viscoelastic materials. (2) We provide the conditions for satisfying frame indifference for anisotropic nonlinear viscoelasticity, including for tension-bearing fiber models. Code verifications and model validations against experimental data provide evidence in support of this updated formulation.},

	abstract = {Mixture theory is a general framework that has been used to model mixtures of solid, fluid, and solute constituents, leading to significant advances in modeling the mechanics of biological tissues and cells. Though versatile and applicable to a wide range of problems in biomechanics and biophysics, standard multiphasic mixture frameworks incorporate neither dynamics of viscous fluids nor fluid compressibility, both of which facilitate the finite element implementation of computational fluid dynamics solvers. This study formulates governing equations for reactive multiphasic mixtures where the interstitial fluid has a solvent which is viscous and compressible. This hybrid reactive multiphasic framework uses state variables that include the deformation gradient of the porous solid matrix, the volumetric strain and rate of deformation of the solvent, the solute concentrations, and the relative velocities between the various constituents. Unlike standard formulations which employ a Lagrange multiplier to model fluid pressure, this framework requires the formulation of a function of state for the pressure, which depends on solvent volumetric strain and solute concentrations. Under isothermal conditions the formulation shows that the solvent volumetric strain remains continuous across interfaces between hybrid multiphasic domains. Apart from the Lagrange multiplier-state function distinction for the fluid pressure, and the ability to accommodate viscous fluid dynamics, this hybrid multiphasic framework remains fully consistent with standard multiphasic formulations previously employed in biomechanics. With these additional features, the hybrid multiphasic mixture theory makes it possible to address a wider range of problems that are important in biomechanics and mechanobiology.},

@article{Zimmerman22,
	abstract = {The frictional response of porous and permeable hydrated biological tissues such as articular cartilage is significantly dependent on interstitial fluid pressurization. To model this response, it is common to represent such tissues as biphasic materials, consisting of a binary mixture of a porous solid matrix and an interstitial fluid. However, no computational algorithms currently exist in either commercial or open-source software that can model frictional contact between such materials. Therefore, this study formulates and implements a finite element algorithm for large deformation biphasic frictional contact in the open-source finite element software FEBio. This algorithm relies on a local form of a biphasic friction model that has been previously validated against experiments, and implements the model into our recently-developed surface-to-surface (STS) contact algorithm. Contact constraints, including those specific to pressurized porous media, are enforced with the penalty method regularized with an active-passive augmented Lagrangian scheme. Numerical difficulties specific to challenging finite deformation biphasic contact problems are overcome with novel smoothing schemes for fluid pressures and Lagrange multipliers. Implementation accuracy is verified against semi-analytical solutions for biphasic frictional contact, with extensive validation performed using canonical cartilage friction experiments from prior literature. Essential details of the formulation are provided in this paper, and the source code of this biphasic frictional contact algorithm is made available to the general public.},

@article{Ateshian22a,
	abstract = {Mixture theory models continua consisting of multiple constituents with independent motions. In constrained mixtures, all constituents share the same velocity but they may have different reference configurations. The theory of constrained reactive mixtures was formulated to analyze growth and remodeling in living biological tissues. It can also reproduce and extend classical frameworks of damage mechanics and viscoelasticity under isothermal conditions, when modeling bonds that can break and reform. This study focuses on establishing the thermodynamic foundations of constrained reactive mixtures under more general conditions, for arbitrary reactive processes where temperature varies in time and space. By incorporating general expressions for reaction kinetics, it is shown that the residual dissipation statement of the Clausius-Duhem inequality must include a reactive power density, while the axiom of energy balance must include a reactive heat supply density. Both of these functions are proportional to the molar production rate of a reaction, and they depend on the chemical potentials of the mixture constituents. We present novel formulas for the classical thermodynamic concepts of energy of formation and heat of reaction, making it possible to evaluate the heat supply generated by reactive processes from the knowledge of the specific free energy of mixture constituents as well as the reaction rate. We illustrate these novel concepts with mixtures of ideal gases, and isothermal reactive damage mechanics and viscoelasticity, as well as reactive thermoelasticity. This framework facilitates the analysis of reactive tissue biomechanics and physiological and biomedical engineering processes where temperature variations cannot be neglected.},

@article{Shim22,
	abstract = {The primary aim of this study is to establish the theoretical foundations for a solid-fluid biphasic mixture domain that can accommodate inertial effects and a viscous interstitial fluid, which can interface with a dynamic viscous fluid domain. Most mixture formulations consist of constituents that are either all intrinsically incompressible or compressible, thereby introducing inherent limitations. In particular, mixtures with intrinsically incompressible constituents can only model wave propagation in the porous solid matrix, whereas those with compressible constituents require internal variables, and related evolution equations, to distinguish the compressibility of the solid and fluid under hydrostatic pressure. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework for a biphasic mixture where the skeleton of the porous solid is intrinsically incompressible but the interstitial fluid is compressible. We define a state variable as a measure of the fluid volumetric strain. Within an isothermal framework, the Clausius-Duhem inequality shows that a function of state arises for the fluid pressure as a function of this strain measure. We derive jump conditions across hybrid biphasic interfaces, which are suitable for modeling hydrated biological tissues. We then illustrate this framework using confined compression and dilatational wave propagation analyses. The governing equations for this hybrid biphasic framework reduce to those of the classical biphasic theory whenever the bulk modulus of the fluid is set to infinity and inertia terms and viscous fluid effects are neglected. The availability of this novel framework facilitates the implementation of finite element solvers for fluid-structure interactions at interfaces between viscous fluids and porous-deformable biphasic domains, which can include fluid exchanges across those interfaces.},

Experimental tests include isometric tension development, isotonic loading, quick-release/restretch, length step and sinusoidal perturbations. We show that all of these experiments can be interpreted with a four state variable model which includes (i) the passive elasticity of myocardial tissue, (ii) the rapid binding of Ca2+ to troponin C and its slower tension-dependent release, (iii) the kinetics of tropomyosin movement and availability of crossbridge binding sites and the length dependence of this process and (iv) the kinetics of crossbridge tension development under perturbations of myofilament length.},

@article{Estrada20,
	abstract = {A wide range of emerging therapies, from surgical restraint to biomaterial injection to tissue engineering, aim to improve heart function and limit adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). We previously showed that longitudinal surgical reinforcement of large anterior infarcts in dogs could significantly enhance systolic function without restricting diastolic function, but the underlying mechanisms for this improvement are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to construct a finite element model that could match our previously published data on changes in regional strains and left ventricular function following longitudinal surgical reinforcement, then use the model to explore potential mechanisms for the improvement in systolic function we observed. The model presented here, implemented in febio, matches all the key features of our experiments, including diastolic remodeling strains in the ischemic region, small shifts in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR), and large changes in the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) in response to ischemia and to patch application. Detailed examination of model strains and stresses suggests that longitudinal reinforcement reduces peak diastolic fiber stretch and systolic fiber stress in the remote myocardium and shifts those peaks away from the endocardial surface by reshaping the left ventricle (LV). These findings could help to guide the development of novel therapies to improve post-MI function by providing specific design objectives.},

The algorithm uses a penalty method regularized with an augmented Lagrangian scheme to enforce contact constraints in a nonmortar surface-to-surface approach. Use of a novel kinematical approach to contact detection and enforcement of frictional constraints allows solution of complex problems previously requiring mortar methods or contact smoothing algorithms. Patch tests are satisfied to a high degree of accuracy with a single-pass penalty method, ensuring formulation errors do not affect the solution. The accuracy of the implementation is verified with Hertzian contact, and illustrations demonstrating the ability to handle large deformations and sliding are presented and validated against prior literature. A biomechanically relevant example addressing finger friction during grasping demonstrates the utility of the proposed algorithm.

@article{Ateshian09b,
	abstract = {Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been reported in the field of cartilage mechanics that impacts our understanding of the role of interstitial fluid pressurization on cartilage lubrication. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the interstitial fluid of cartilage pressurizes considerably under loading, potentially supporting most of the applied load under various transient or steady-state conditions. The fraction of the total load supported by fluid pressurization has been called the fluid load support. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the friction coefficient of cartilage correlates negatively with this variable, achieving remarkably low values when the fluid load support is greatest. A theoretical framework that embodies this relationship has been validated against experiments, predicting and explaining various outcomes, and demonstrating that a low friction coefficient can be maintained for prolonged loading durations under normal physiological function. This paper reviews salient aspects of this topic, as well as its implications for improving our understanding of boundary lubrication by molecular species in synovial fluid and the cartilage superficial zone. Effects of cartilage degeneration on its frictional response are also reviewed.},

@article{Zimmerman21,
	abstract = {This study presents a framework for plasticity and elastoplastic damage mechanics by treating materials as reactive solids whose internal composition evolves in response to applied loading. Using the framework of constrained reactive mixtures, plastic deformation is accounted for by allowing loaded bonds within the material to break and reform in a stressed state. Bonds which break and reform represent a new generation with a new reference configuration, which is time-invariant and provided by constitutive assumption. The constitutive relation for the reference configuration of each generation may depend on the selection of a suitable yield measure. The choice of this measure and the resulting plastic flow conditions are constrained by the Clausius-Duhem inequality. We show that this framework remains consistent with classical plasticity approaches and principles. Verification of this reactive plasticity framework, which is implemented in the open source FEBio finite element software (febio.org), is performed against standard 2D and 3D benchmark problems. Damage is incorporated into this reactive framework by allowing loaded bonds to break permanently according to a suitable damage measure, where broken bonds can no longer store free energy. Validation is also demonstrated against experimental data for problems involving plasticity and plastic damage. This study demonstrates that it is possible to formulate simple elastoplasticity and elastoplastic damage models within a consistent framework which uses measures of material mass composition as theoretically observable state variables. This theoretical frame can be expanded in scope to account for more complex behaviors.},

A "pseudo-no-slip" kinematic boundary condition is proposed based upon the principle that the conditions at the interface between mixtures or mixtures and fluids must reduce to those boundary conditions in single phase continuum mechanics. From this proposed kinematic boundary condition, and balances of mass, momentum and energy, the boundary conditions at the interface between a biphasic mixture and a Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid are mathematically derived. Based upon these general results, the appropriate boundary conditions needed in modeling the cartilage-synovial fluid-cartilage lubrication problem are deduced. For two simple cases where a Newtonian viscous fluid is forced to flow (with imposed Couette or Poiseuille flow conditions) over a porous-permeable biphasic material of relatively low permeability, the well known empirical Taylor slip condition may be derived using matched asymptotic analysis of the boundary layer at the interface.},

@article{Shim19,
	abstract = {Many physiological systems involve strong interactions between fluids and solids, posing a signicant challenge when modeling biomechanics. The objective of this study was to implement a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver in the free, open-source finite element code FEBio (febio.org), that combined the existing solid mechanics and rigid body dynamics solver with a recently-developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. A novel Galerkin-based finite element FSI formulation was introduced based on mixture theory, where the FSI domain was described as a mixture of fluid and solid constituents that have distinct motions. The mesh was defined on the solid domain, specialized to have zero mass, negligible stiffness and zero frictional interactions with the fluid, whereas the fluid was modeled as isothermal and compressible. The mixture framework provided the foundation for evaluating material time derivatives in a material frame for the solid and in a spatial frame for the fluid. Similar to our recently reported CFD solver, our FSI formulation did not require stabilization methods to achieve good convergence, producing a compact set of equations and code implementation. The code was successfully verified against benchmark problems and an analytical solution for squeeze-film lubrication. It was validated against experimental measurements of the flow rate in a peristaltic pump, and illustrated using non-Newtonian blood flow through a bifurcated carotid artery with a thick arterial wall. The successful formulation and implementation of this FSI solver enhances the multiphysics modeling capabilities in FEBio relevant to the biomechanics and biophysics communities.},

@article{Gatti20,
	abstract = {Pulse wave imaging (PWI) is an ultrasound-based method that allows spatiotemporal mapping of the arterial pulse wave propagation, from which the local pulse wave velocity (PWV) can be derived. Recent reports indicate that PWI can help the assessment of atherosclerotic plaque composition and mechanical properties. However, the effect of the atherosclerotic plaque's geometry and mechanics on the arterial wall distension and local PWV remains unclear. In this study we investigated the accuracy of a finite element (FE) fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach to predict the velocity of a pulse wave propagating through a stenotic artery with an asymmetrical plaque, as quantified with PWI method. Experiments were designed to compare FE-FSI modeling of the pulse wave propagation through a stenotic artery against PWI obtained with manufactured phantom arteries made of PVA material. FSI-generated spatiotemporal maps were used to estimate PWV at the plaque region and compare it to the experimental results. Velocity of the pulse wave propagation and magnitude of the wall distension were correctly predicted with the FE analysis. In addition, findings indicate that a plaque with a high degree of stenosis (>70%) attenuates the propagation of the pulse pressure wave. Results of this study support the validity of the FE-FSI methods to investigate the effect of arterial wall structural and mechanical properties on the pulse wave propagation. This modeling method can help to guide the optimization of PWI to characterize plaque properties and substantiate clinical findings.},

@article{Shim21,
	abstract = {In biomechanics, solid-fluid mixtures have commonly been used to model the response of hydrated biological tissues. In cartilage mechanics, this type of mixture, where the fluid and solid constituents are both assumed to be intrinsically incompressible, is often called a biphasic material. Various physiological processes involve the interaction of a viscous fluid with a porous-hydrated tissue, as encountered in synovial joint lubrication, cardiovascular mechanics, and respiratory mechanics. The objective of this study was to implement a finite element solver in the open-source software FEBio that models dynamic interactions between a viscous fluid and a biphasic domain, accommodating finite deformations of both domains as well as fluid exchanges between them. For compatibility with our recent implementation of solvers for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and fluid-structure interactions (FSI), where the fluid is slightly compressible, this study employs a novel hybrid biphasic formulation where the porous skeleton is intrinsically incompressible but the fluid is also slightly compressible. The resulting biphasic-FSI (BFSI) implementation is verified against published analytical and numerical benchmark problems, as well as novel analytical solutions derived for the purposes of this study. An illustration of this BFSI solver is presented for two-dimensional air flow through a simulated face mask under five cycles of breathing, showing that masks significantly reduce air dispersion compared to the no-mask control analysis. The successful formulation and implementation of this BFSI solver offers enhanced multiphysics modeling capabilities that are accessible via an open-source software platform.},

@article{Nims16,
	abstract = {This study presents a damage mechanics framework that employs observable state variables to describe damage in isotropic or anisotropic fibrous tissues. In this mixture theory framework, damage is tracked by the mass fraction of bonds that have broken. Anisotropic damage is subsumed in the assumption that multiple bond species may coexist in a material, each having its own damage behaviour. This approach recovers the classical damage mechanics formulation for isotropic materials, but does not appeal to a tensorial damage measure for anisotropic materials. In contrast with the classical approach, the use of observable state variables for damage allows direct comparison of model predictions to experimental damage measures, such as biochemical assays or Raman spectroscopy. Investigations of damage in discrete fibre distributions demonstrate that the resilience to damage increases with the number of fibre bundles; idealizing fibrous tissues using continuous fibre distribution models precludes the modelling of damage. This damage framework was used to test and validate the hypothesis that growth of cartilage constructs can lead to damage of the synthesized collagen matrix due to excessive swelling caused by synthesized glycosaminoglycans. Therefore, alternative strategies must be implemented in tissue engineering studies to prevent collagen damage during the growth process. },

@article{Gasser06,
	abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stress-strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel & Gasser (Holzapfel & Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379-4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1-48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

@article{Ateshian18,
	abstract = {The mechanics of biological fluids is an important topic in biomechanics, often requiring the use of computational tools to analyze problems with realistic geometries and material properties. This study describes the formulation and implementation of a finite element framework for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in FEBio, a free software designed to meet the computational needs of the biomechanics and biophysics communities. This formulation models nearly incompressible flow with a compressible isothermal formulation that uses a physically realistic value for the fluid bulk modulus. It employs fluid velocity and dilatation as essential variables: The virtual work integral enforces the balance of linear momentum and the kinematic constraint between fluid velocity and dilatation, while fluid density varies with dilatation as prescribed by the axiom of mass balance. Using this approach, equal-order interpolations may be used for both essential variables over each element, contrary to traditional mixed formulations that must explicitly satisfy the inf-sup condition. The formulation accommodates Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscous responses as well as inviscid fluids. The efficiency of numerical solutions is enhanced using Broyden's quasi-Newton method. The results of finite element simulations were verified using well-documented benchmark problems as well as comparisons with other free and commercial codes. These analyses demonstrated that the novel formulation introduced in FEBio could successfully reproduce the results of other codes. The analogy between this CFD formulation and standard finite element formulations for solid mechanics makes it suitable for future extension to fluid-structure interactions (FSIs).},

	abstract = {Effects of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on a flow in a coronary arterial casting of man were studied numerically using a finite element method. Various constitutive models were examined to model the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood and their model constants were summarized. A method to incorporate the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was introduced so that the viscosity could be calculated locally. The pressure drop, wall shear stress and velocity profiles for the case of blood viscosity were compared for the case of Newtonian viscosity (0.0345 poise). The effect of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on the overall pressure drop across the arterial casting was found to be significant at a flow of the Reynolds number of 100 or less. Also in the region of flow separation or recirculation, the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood yields larger wall shear stress than the Newtonian case. The origin of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was discussed in relation to the viscoelasticity and yield stress of blood.},

By reducing the integral statements of external virtual work on the two contacting surfaces into a single contact integral, the algorithm automatically enforces continuity of solute molar flux across the contact interface, whereas continuity of the effective solute concentration (a measure of the solute mechano-chemical potential) is achieved using a penalty method. This novel formulation facilitates the analysis of problems in biomechanics where the transport of metabolites across contact interfaces of deformable tissues may be of interest.

@article{Azeloglu08,
	abstract = {The arterial wall contains a significant amount of charged proteoglycans, which are inhomogeneously distributed, with the greatest concentrations in the intimal and medial layers. The hypothesis of this study is that the transmural distribution of proteoglycans plays a significant role in regulating residual stresses in the arterial wall. This hypothesis was first tested theoretically, using the framework of mixture theory for charged hydrated tissues, and then verified experimentally by measuring the opening angle of rat aorta in NaCl solutions of various ionic strengths. A three-dimensional finite element model of aortic ring, using realistic values of the solid matrix shear modulus and proteoglycan fixed-charge density, yielded opening angles and changes with osmolarity comparable to values reported in the literature. Experimentally, the mean opening angle in isotonic saline (300 mosM) was 15 +/- 17 degrees and changed to 4 +/- 19 degrees and 73 +/- 18 degrees under hypertonic (2,000 mosM) and hypotonic (0 mosM) conditions, respectively (n = 16). In addition, the opening angle in isotonic (300 mosM) sucrose, an uncharged molecule, was 60 +/- 16 degrees (n = 11), suggesting that the charge effect, not cellular swelling, was the major underlying mechanism for these observations. The extent of changes in opening angle under osmotic challenges suggests that transmural heterogeneity of fixed-charge density plays a crucial role in governing the zero-stress configuration of the aorta. A significant implication of this finding is that arterial wall remodeling in response to altered wall stresses may occur via altered deposition of proteoglycans across the wall thickness, providing a novel mechanism for regulating mechanical homeostasis in vascular tissue.},

@article{Weinans92,
	abstract = {The process of adaptive bone remodeling can be described mathematically and simulated in a computer model, integrated with the finite element method. In the model discussed here, cortical and trabecular bone are described as continuous materials with variable density. The remodeling rule applied to simulate the remodeling process in each element individually is, in fact, an objective function for an optimization process, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a constant, preset value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the density. If an element in the structure cannot achieve that, it either turns to its maximal density (cortical bone) or resorbs completely. It is found that the solution obtained in generally a discontinuous patchwork. For a two-dimensional proximal femur model this patchwork shows a good resemblance with the density distribution of a real proximal femur. It is shown that the discontinuous end configuration is dictated by the nature of the differential equations describing the remodeling process. This process can be considered as a nonlinear dynamical system with many degrees of freedom, which behaves divergent relative to the objective, leading to many possible solutions. The precise solution is dependent on the parameters in the remodeling rule, the load and the initial conditions. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing, denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even more dense. It is suggested that this positive feedback of the attractor state (the strain energy field) creates order in the end configuration. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass, perhaps a minimal-mass structure, although this is no explicit objective in the optimization process. It is hypothesized that trabecular bone is a chaotically ordered structure which can be considered as a fractal with characteristics of optimal mechanical resistance and minimal mass, of which the actual morphology depends on the local (internal) loading characteristics, the sensor-cell density and the degree of mineralization.},

	abstract = {This study reports experimental measurements of solute diffusivity and partition coefficient for various solute concentrations and gel porosities, and proposes novel constitutive relations to describe these observed values. The longer-term aim is to explore the theoretical ramifications of accommodating variations in diffusivity and partition coefficient with solute concentration and tissue porosity, and investigate whether they might suggest novel mechanisms not previously recognized in the field of solute transport in deformable porous media. The study implements a model transport system of agarose hydrogels to investigate the effect of solute concentration and hydrogel porosity on the transport of dextran polysaccharides. The proposed phenomenological constitutive relations are shown to provide better fits of experimental results than prior models proposed in the literature based on the microstructure of the gel. While these constitutive models were developed for the transport of dextran in agarose hydrogels, it is expected that they may also be applied to the transport of similar molecular weight solutes in other porous media. This quantification can assist in the application of biophysical models that describe biological transport in deformable tissues, as well as the cell cytoplasm.},

@article{Ateshian15,
	abstract = {This study presents a framework for viscoelasticity where the free energy density depends on the stored energy of intact strong and weak bonds, where weak bonds break and reform in response to loading. The stress is evaluated by differentiating the free energy density with respect to the deformation gradient, similar to the conventional approach for hyperelasticity. The breaking and reformation of weak bonds is treated as a reaction governed by the axiom of mass balance, where the constitutive relation for the mass supply governs the bond kinetics. The evolving mass contents of these weak bonds serve as observable state variables. Weak bonds reform in an energy-free and stress-free state, therefore their reference configuration is given by the current configuration at the time of their reformation. A principal advantage of this formulation is the availability of a strain energy density function that depends only on observable state variables, also allowing for a separation of the contributions of strong and weak bonds. The Clausius-Duhem inequality is satisfied by requiring that the net free energy from all breaking bonds must be decreasing at all times. In the limit of infinitesimal strains, linear stress-strain responses and first-order kinetics for breaking and reforming of weak bonds, the reactive framework reduces exactly to classical linear viscoelasticity. For large strains, the reactive and classical quasilinear viscoelasticity theories produce different equations, though responses to standard loading configurations behave similarly. This formulation complements existing tools for modeling the nonlinear viscoelastic response of biological soft tissues under large deformations.},

@article{Lai91,
	abstract = {Swelling of articular cartilage depends on its fixed charge density and distribution, the stiffness of its collagen-proteoglycan matrix, and the ion concentrations in the interstitium. A theory for a tertiary mixture has been developed, including the two fluid-solid phases (biphasic), and an ion phase, representing cation and anion of a single salt, to describe the deformation and stress fields for cartilage under chemical and/or mechanical loads. This triphasic theory combines the physico-chemical theory for ionic and polyionic (proteoglycan) solutions with the biphasic theory for cartilage. The present model assumes the fixed charge groups to remain unchanged, and that the counter-ions are the cations of a single-salt of the bathing solution. The momentum equation for the neutral salt and for the intersitial water are expressed in terms of their chemical potentials whose gradients are the driving forces for their movements. These chemical potentials depend on fluid pressure p, salt concentration c, solid matrix dilatation e and fixed charge density cF. For a uni-uni valent salt such as NaCl, they are given by mu i = mu io + (RT/Mi)ln[gamma 2 +/- c(c + cF)] and mu w = mu wo + [p-RT phi (2c + cF) + Bwe]/pwT, where R, T, Mi, gamma +/-, phi, pwT and Bw are universal gas constant, absolute temperature, molecular weight, mean activity coefficient of salt, osmotic coefficient, true density of water, and a coupling material coefficient, respectively. For infinitesimal strains and material isotropy, the stress-strain relationship for the total mixture stress is sigma = - pI-TcI + lambda s(trE)I + 2 musE, where E is the strain tensor and (lambda s, mu s) are the Lam{\'e} constants of the elastic solid matrix. The chemical-expansion stress (-Tc) derives from the charge-to-charge repulsive forces within the solid matrix. This theory can be applied to both equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. For equilibrium free swelling problems, the theory yields the well known Donnan equilibrium ion distribution and osmotic pressure equations, along with an analytical expression for the "pre-stress" in the solid matrix. For the confined-compression swelling problem, it predicts that the applied compressive stress is shared by three load support mechanisms: 1) the Donnan osmotic pressure; 2) the chemical-expansion stress; and 3) the solid matrix elastic stress. Numerical calculations have been made, based on a set of equilibrium free-swelling and confined-compression data, to assess the relative contribution of each mechanism to load support. Our results show that all three mechanisms are important in determining the overall compressive stiffness of cartilage.},

	abstract = {Compression tests of human and bovine trabecular bone specimens with and without marrow in situ were conducted at strain rates of from 0.001 to 10.0 per second. A porous platen above the specimens allowed the escape of marrow during testing. The presence of marrow increased the strength, modulus, and energy absorption of specimens only at the highest strain rate of 10.0 per second. This enhancement of material properties at the highest strain rate was due primarily to the restricted viscous flow of marrow through the platen rather than the flow through the pores of the trabecular bone. In specimens without marrow, the strength was proportional to the square of the apparent density and the modulus was proportional to the cube of the apparent density. Both strength and modulus were approximately proportional to the strain rate raised to the 0.06 power. These power relationships, which were shown to hold for all bone in the skeleton, allow meaningful predictions of bone tissue strength and stiffness based on in vivo density measurements.},

	abstract = {Porous-permeable tissues have often been modeled using porous media theories such as the biphasic theory. This study examines the equivalence of the short-time biphasic and incompressible elastic responses for arbitrary deformations and constitutive relations from first principles. This equivalence is illustrated in problems of unconfined compression of a disk, and of articular contact under finite deformation, using two different constitutive relations for the solid matrix of cartilage, one of which accounts for the large disparity observed between the tensile and compressive moduli in this tissue. Demonstrating this equivalence under general conditions provides a rationale for using available finite element codes for incompressible elastic materials as a practical substitute for biphasic analyses, so long as only the short-time biphasic response is sought. In practice, an incompressible elastic analysis is representative of a biphasic analysis over the short-term response deltat<Delta(2) / //parallelC(4)//K//, where Delta is a characteristic dimension, C(4) is the elasticity tensor, and K is the hydraulic permeability tensor of the solid matrix. Certain notes of caution are provided with regard to implementation issues, particularly when finite element formulations of incompressible elasticity employ an uncoupled strain energy function consisting of additive deviatoric and volumetric components.},

@article{ALLAN2022105342,
	abstract = {Many painful and physically debilitating conditions involve sub-failure mechanical damage to seemingly intact connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments. We found that the amount of denatured collagen in rat tail tendon (RTT) fascicles increased over experiments of cyclic loading to a constant load level (creep cyclic fatigue) with fluorescently tagged collagen hybridizing peptides (CHPs) that bind to denatured collagen. To better understand tendon sub-failure damage progression, computational modeling of tendon materials via finite element analysis in FEBio has been conducted. The objective of this project was to develop, implement, and test the ability of a new continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model in FEBio to represent the sub-failure damage behavior seen in our RTT fascicle creep cyclic fatigue experimental data. There appeared to be two distinct mechanisms responsible for the creep cyclic fatigue softening behavior of RTT fascicles over the number of cycles to failure: the preconditioning effect and overall collagen damage. In our finite element (FE) models, the RTT fascicle undamaged elastic constitutive material was composed of a matrix and fibers described by the Coupled Veronda-Westmann and exponential-linear materials. This undamaged elastic material was convolved with a modified CDM model adapted from Balzani et al., in 2012. The novelty of the Balzani damage model is the inclusion of two interrelated mechanisms described as continuous and discontinuous damage. The continuous damage formulation calculates damage accumulation during the loading and reloading of each new cycle, while the discontinuous damage approach accumulates damage from the maximum strain over the loading history to the current time. We modified the Balzani damage model formulations to represent exponential and sigmoidal increases in damage marked by the preconditioning effect and collagen damage in RTT fascicles as functions of continuous and discontinuous damage. The original Balzani damage model was first verified, then the modified CDM model was implemented into FEBio and used to reproduce the sample specific experimental creep cyclic fatigue stress-strain data as well as predict incremental cyclic fatigue. The resulting model will be useful for future experimental and computational studies of damage mechanics to understand tendon pathologies.},
