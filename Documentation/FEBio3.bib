	Abstract = {The mechanics of biological fluids is an important topic in biomechanics, often requiring the use of computational tools to analyze problems with realistic geometries and material properties. This study describes the formulation and implementation of a finite element framework for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in FEBio, a free software designed to meet the computational needs of the biomechanics and biophysics communities. This formulation models nearly incompressible flow with a compressible isothermal formulation that uses a physically realistic value for the fluid bulk modulus. It employs fluid velocity and dilatation as essential variables: The virtual work integral enforces the balance of linear momentum and the kinematic constraint between fluid velocity and dilatation, while fluid density varies with dilatation as prescribed by the axiom of mass balance. Using this approach, equal-order interpolations may be used for both essential variables over each element, contrary to traditional mixed formulations that must explicitly satisfy the inf-sup condition. The formulation accommodates Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscous responses as well as inviscid fluids. The efficiency of numerical solutions is enhanced using Broyden's quasi-Newton method. The results of finite element simulations were verified using well-documented benchmark problems as well as comparisons with other free and commercial codes. These analyses demonstrated that the novel formulation introduced in FEBio could successfully reproduce the results of other codes. The analogy between this CFD formulation and standard finite element formulations for solid mechanics makes it suitable for future extension to fluid-structure interactions (FSIs).},

@article{Cho91,
	Abstract = {Effects of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on a flow in a coronary arterial casting of man were studied numerically using a finite element method. Various constitutive models were examined to model the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood and their model constants were summarized. A method to incorporate the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was introduced so that the viscosity could be calculated locally. The pressure drop, wall shear stress and velocity profiles for the case of blood viscosity were compared for the case of Newtonian viscosity (0.0345 poise). The effect of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood on the overall pressure drop across the arterial casting was found to be significant at a flow of the Reynolds number of 100 or less. Also in the region of flow separation or recirculation, the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood yields larger wall shear stress than the Newtonian case. The origin of the non-Newtonian viscosity of blood was discussed in relation to the viscoelasticity and yield stress of blood.},

	Abstract = {A finite element formulation of neutral solute transport across a contact interface between deformable porous media is implemented and validated against analytical solutions. By reducing the integral statements of external virtual work on the two contacting surfaces into a single contact integral, the algorithm automatically enforces continuity of solute molar flux across the contact interface, whereas continuity of the effective solute concentration (a measure of the solute mechano-chemical potential) is achieved using a penalty method. This novel formulation facilitates the analysis of problems in biomechanics where the transport of metabolites across contact interfaces of deformable tissues may be of interest. This contact algorithm is the first to address solute transport across deformable interfaces, and is made available in the public domain, open-source finite element code FEBio (http://www.febio.org).},

@article{Azeloglu08,
	Abstract = {The arterial wall contains a significant amount of charged proteoglycans, which are inhomogeneously distributed, with the greatest concentrations in the intimal and medial layers. The hypothesis of this study is that the transmural distribution of proteoglycans plays a significant role in regulating residual stresses in the arterial wall. This hypothesis was first tested theoretically, using the framework of mixture theory for charged hydrated tissues, and then verified experimentally by measuring the opening angle of rat aorta in NaCl solutions of various ionic strengths. A three-dimensional finite element model of aortic ring, using realistic values of the solid matrix shear modulus and proteoglycan fixed-charge density, yielded opening angles and changes with osmolarity comparable to values reported in the literature. Experimentally, the mean opening angle in isotonic saline (300 mosM) was 15 +/- 17 degrees and changed to 4 +/- 19 degrees and 73 +/- 18 degrees under hypertonic (2,000 mosM) and hypotonic (0 mosM) conditions, respectively (n = 16). In addition, the opening angle in isotonic (300 mosM) sucrose, an uncharged molecule, was 60 +/- 16 degrees (n = 11), suggesting that the charge effect, not cellular swelling, was the major underlying mechanism for these observations. The extent of changes in opening angle under osmotic challenges suggests that transmural heterogeneity of fixed-charge density plays a crucial role in governing the zero-stress configuration of the aorta. A significant implication of this finding is that arterial wall remodeling in response to altered wall stresses may occur via altered deposition of proteoglycans across the wall thickness, providing a novel mechanism for regulating mechanical homeostasis in vascular tissue.},

	Abstract = {The process of adaptive bone remodeling can be described mathematically and simulated in a computer model, integrated with the finite element method. In the model discussed here, cortical and trabecular bone are described as continuous materials with variable density. The remodeling rule applied to simulate the remodeling process in each element individually is, in fact, an objective function for an optimization process, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a constant, preset value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the density. If an element in the structure cannot achieve that, it either turns to its maximal density (cortical bone) or resorbs completely. It is found that the solution obtained in generally a discontinuous patchwork. For a two-dimensional proximal femur model this patchwork shows a good resemblance with the density distribution of a real proximal femur. It is shown that the discontinuous end configuration is dictated by the nature of the differential equations describing the remodeling process. This process can be considered as a nonlinear dynamical system with many degrees of freedom, which behaves divergent relative to the objective, leading to many possible solutions. The precise solution is dependent on the parameters in the remodeling rule, the load and the initial conditions. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing, denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even more dense. It is suggested that this positive feedback of the attractor state (the strain energy field) creates order in the end configuration. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass, perhaps a minimal-mass structure, although this is no explicit objective in the optimization process. It is hypothesized that trabecular bone is a chaotically ordered structure which can be considered as a fractal with characteristics of optimal mechanical resistance and minimal mass, of which the actual morphology depends on the local (internal) loading characteristics, the sensor-cell density and the degree of mineralization.},

	Abstract = {This study reports experimental measurements of solute diffusivity and partition coefficient for various solute concentrations and gel porosities, and proposes novel constitutive relations to describe these observed values. The longer-term aim is to explore the theoretical ramifications of accommodating variations in diffusivity and partition coefficient with solute concentration and tissue porosity, and investigate whether they might suggest novel mechanisms not previously recognized in the field of solute transport in deformable porous media. The study implements a model transport system of agarose hydrogels to investigate the effect of solute concentration and hydrogel porosity on the transport of dextran polysaccharides. The proposed phenomenological constitutive relations are shown to provide better fits of experimental results than prior models proposed in the literature based on the microstructure of the gel. While these constitutive models were developed for the transport of dextran in agarose hydrogels, it is expected that they may also be applied to the transport of similar molecular weight solutes in other porous media. This quantification can assist in the application of biophysical models that describe biological transport in deformable tissues, as well as the cell cytoplasm.},

@article{Ateshian15,
	Abstract = {This study presents a framework for viscoelasticity where the free energy density depends on the stored energy of intact strong and weak bonds, where weak bonds break and reform in response to loading. The stress is evaluated by differentiating the free energy density with respect to the deformation gradient, similar to the conventional approach for hyperelasticity. The breaking and reformation of weak bonds is treated as a reaction governed by the axiom of mass balance, where the constitutive relation for the mass supply governs the bond kinetics. The evolving mass contents of these weak bonds serve as observable state variables. Weak bonds reform in an energy-free and stress-free state, therefore their reference configuration is given by the current configuration at the time of their reformation. A principal advantage of this formulation is the availability of a strain energy density function that depends only on observable state variables, also allowing for a separation of the contributions of strong and weak bonds. The Clausius-Duhem inequality is satisfied by requiring that the net free energy from all breaking bonds must be decreasing at all times. In the limit of infinitesimal strains, linear stress-strain responses and first-order kinetics for breaking and reforming of weak bonds, the reactive framework reduces exactly to classical linear viscoelasticity. For large strains, the reactive and classical quasilinear viscoelasticity theories produce different equations, though responses to standard loading configurations behave similarly. This formulation complements existing tools for modeling the nonlinear viscoelastic response of biological soft tissues under large deformations.},

@article{Lai91,
	Abstract = {Swelling of articular cartilage depends on its fixed charge density and distribution, the stiffness of its collagen-proteoglycan matrix, and the ion concentrations in the interstitium. A theory for a tertiary mixture has been developed, including the two fluid-solid phases (biphasic), and an ion phase, representing cation and anion of a single salt, to describe the deformation and stress fields for cartilage under chemical and/or mechanical loads. This triphasic theory combines the physico-chemical theory for ionic and polyionic (proteoglycan) solutions with the biphasic theory for cartilage. The present model assumes the fixed charge groups to remain unchanged, and that the counter-ions are the cations of a single-salt of the bathing solution. The momentum equation for the neutral salt and for the intersitial water are expressed in terms of their chemical potentials whose gradients are the driving forces for their movements. These chemical potentials depend on fluid pressure p, salt concentration c, solid matrix dilatation e and fixed charge density cF. For a uni-uni valent salt such as NaCl, they are given by mu i = mu io + (RT/Mi)ln[gamma 2 +/- c(c + cF)] and mu w = mu wo + [p-RT phi (2c + cF) + Bwe]/pwT, where R, T, Mi, gamma +/-, phi, pwT and Bw are universal gas constant, absolute temperature, molecular weight, mean activity coefficient of salt, osmotic coefficient, true density of water, and a coupling material coefficient, respectively. For infinitesimal strains and material isotropy, the stress-strain relationship for the total mixture stress is sigma = - pI-TcI + lambda s(trE)I + 2 musE, where E is the strain tensor and (lambda s, mu s) are the Lam{\'e} constants of the elastic solid matrix. The chemical-expansion stress (-Tc) derives from the charge-to-charge repulsive forces within the solid matrix. This theory can be applied to both equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. For equilibrium free swelling problems, the theory yields the well known Donnan equilibrium ion distribution and osmotic pressure equations, along with an analytical expression for the "pre-stress" in the solid matrix. For the confined-compression swelling problem, it predicts that the applied compressive stress is shared by three load support mechanisms: 1) the Donnan osmotic pressure; 2) the chemical-expansion stress; and 3) the solid matrix elastic stress. Numerical calculations have been made, based on a set of equilibrium free-swelling and confined-compression data, to assess the relative contribution of each mechanism to load support. Our results show that all three mechanisms are important in determining the overall compressive stiffness of cartilage.},

	Abstract = {Compression tests of human and bovine trabecular bone specimens with and without marrow in situ were conducted at strain rates of from 0.001 to 10.0 per second. A porous platen above the specimens allowed the escape of marrow during testing. The presence of marrow increased the strength, modulus, and energy absorption of specimens only at the highest strain rate of 10.0 per second. This enhancement of material properties at the highest strain rate was due primarily to the restricted viscous flow of marrow through the platen rather than the flow through the pores of the trabecular bone. In specimens without marrow, the strength was proportional to the square of the apparent density and the modulus was proportional to the cube of the apparent density. Both strength and modulus were approximately proportional to the strain rate raised to the 0.06 power. These power relationships, which were shown to hold for all bone in the skeleton, allow meaningful predictions of bone tissue strength and stiffness based on in vivo density measurements.},

	Abstract = {Porous-permeable tissues have often been modeled using porous media theories such as the biphasic theory. This study examines the equivalence of the short-time biphasic and incompressible elastic responses for arbitrary deformations and constitutive relations from first principles. This equivalence is illustrated in problems of unconfined compression of a disk, and of articular contact under finite deformation, using two different constitutive relations for the solid matrix of cartilage, one of which accounts for the large disparity observed between the tensile and compressive moduli in this tissue. Demonstrating this equivalence under general conditions provides a rationale for using available finite element codes for incompressible elastic materials as a practical substitute for biphasic analyses, so long as only the short-time biphasic response is sought. In practice, an incompressible elastic analysis is representative of a biphasic analysis over the short-term response deltat<Delta(2) / //parallelC(4)//K//, where Delta is a characteristic dimension, C(4) is the elasticity tensor, and K is the hydraulic permeability tensor of the solid matrix. Certain notes of caution are provided with regard to implementation issues, particularly when finite element formulations of incompressible elasticity employ an uncoupled strain energy function consisting of additive deviatoric and volumetric components.},
