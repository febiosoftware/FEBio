Plugins are a powerful mechanism for extending FEBio's basic feature set. A plugin is a dynamically linked library that can be loaded by FEBio at runtime. Plugins are typically build and maintained separately from the FEBio source code. 

Plugins can be used to develop new constitutive models, boundary conditions, loads, and other model components. They can be used to extend the xplot database (i.e. plotfile), and log files, and can be used to couple FEBio to other codes.
