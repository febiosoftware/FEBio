\page restart Restart Capabilities

FEBio has several mechanism for restarting a problem. The "running restart" capability allows the model to recover from an otherwise fatal error during runtime and restart
from the last converged state. The "cold restart" allows the user to restart an analysis using a restart file. Again, the analysis will restart from the last converged state (for which a dump file was created). 
The "reset" feature allows a user to reset all data and restart the analysis from scratch. The following sections describe these features in more detail.

\section restart_sec1 Running Restart

The running restart feature allows the analysis to recover from a potentially fatal error. In FEBio, the most common error that triggers a running restart is 
an inverted element. Since in this case the solution has become non-physical, FEBio cannot continue and attempts to do a running restart. The analysis will
restart from the last converged time step and the time step size will be reduced in the hope that the analysis can proceed. 

The way this works in FEBio is as follows. At the beginning of a time step, the current state of the model is backed up using FEModel::PushState. This places 
the current state on a stack. This function in turn calls FEModel::ShallowCopy which will call the ShallowCopy function of all the model components.

Although most of this is taken care of by the framework, in some cases a new class should implement the ShallowCopy member function. This is the case if the class
stores data that describes the state of the model, and that cannot be calculated by re-evaluating the model state at the previous time step. History variables
for material classes is such as example. The Lagrange multipliers for non-linear constraints and contact data is another example.

\section restart_sec2 Cold Restart

The cold restart feature allows an analysis to restart from a restart file. The file can simply define the state of the model at the last converged timestep
or modify certain analysis parameters prior to restarting from the last converged time step. This feature is useful for restarting a model after a program or
system crash.

In FEBio this feature is implemented using the Serialize() member function. Data serialization is explained in more depth in another \ref serialize "technical page".

\section restart_sec3 Model Reset

The model reset allows the user to reset the model to the initial configuration prior to running the model. 

This feature is used in FEBio by the optimization module, which resets the model at the beginning of each optimization iteration.
