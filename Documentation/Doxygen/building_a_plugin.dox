\page building_a_plugin Creating a Plugin

In order to create a plugin you need to have the FEBio SDK (Software Development Kit). This SDK contains the header files and the pre-built libraries that you need to create a plugin. The SDK is installed (optionally) as part of the FEBio Studio installation and is usually installed in the same location as FEBio in a subfolder named sdk. Next, you need a C++ compiler since the plugin has to be written in C++. We also recommend having an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) as this makes writing code much easier (e.g. Visual Studio on Windows, or XCode on Mac). Select one of the following links to learn more about setting up a plugin project for a specific operating system.
