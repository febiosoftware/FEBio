\begin_layout Standard
FEBio is an implicit,
 nonlinear finite element solver that is specifically designed for applications in biomechanics.
 It offers analyses,
 constitutive models and boundary conditions that are relevant for this particular field.
 This section describes briefly the available features of FEBio.
 A more detailed overview of features can be found in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBio supports two analysis types,
 namely 
\emph on
quasi-static
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
quasi-static poroelastic
\emph default
.
 In a 
\emph on
quasi-static
\emph default
 analysis the (quasi-) static response of the system is sought;
 inertial terms are ignored.
 In a 
\emph on
quasi-static poroelastic
\emph default
 analysis a coupled solid-fluid problem is solved.
 The latter analysis type is useful for modeling tissues that have high water content and the explicit modeling of fluid movement relative to the solid phase is important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several nonlinear constitutive models are available to allow the user to model the often complicated biological tissue behavior.
 Several isotropic constitutive models are supported such as Neo-Hookean,
 Mooney-Rivlin,
 Veronda-Westmann,
 Arruda-Boyce and Ogden.
 These models have a nonlinear stress-strain response.
 In addition to the isotropic models,
 there are several anisotropic models available.
 These materials show anisotropic behavior in at least one preferred direction and are useful for modeling biological tissues such as tendons,
 muscles and other tissues that contain fibers.
 FEBio also contains a 
\emph on
rigid body 
\emph default
material model,
 which can be used to model rigid structures whose deformation is negligible compared to the deformable geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Biological tissues can interact in very complicated ways.
 Therefore FEBio supports a wide range of boundary conditions to model these interactions.
 These include prescribed displacements,
 nodal forces,
 and pressure forces.
 Deformable models can also be connected to rigid bodies so that the user can model prescribed rotations and torques.
 Rigid bodies can be connected with rigid joints.
 Even more complicated interactions can be modeled using FEBio's contact interfaces.
 The user can choose between different types of contact interfaces,
 such as sliding interfaces,
 tied interfaces and rigid wall interfaces.
 A sliding interface is defined between two surfaces that are allowed to separate and slide across each other but are not allowed to penetrate.
 The rigid wall interface is also similar to the sliding interface,
 except that one of the contacting surfaces is a movable rigid wall.
 As of version 1.2,
 there is an implementation of a sliding interface that allows for fluid flow crossing the contact interface.
 The tied interface is similar to the sliding interface,
 but in this case,
 the surfaces are not allowed to slide or separate.
 In addition,
 the user may specify a body force which can be used to model the effects of gravity or base acceleration.

 for users who wish to modify or add features to the code,
 and this manual,
 which describes the theory behind most of the FEBio algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this manual is to provide theoretical background on many of the algorithms that are implemented in FEBio.
 In this way the user can develop a better understanding of how the program works and how it can be used to create well defined biomechanical simulations.
 The authors have tried to be as detailed as possible to make the text coherent and comprehensible,
 but due to the complexity of some of the topics,
 some descriptions only skim the surface.
 Many of the theoretical ideas discussed in this manual can and have filled entire bookshelves.
 The explanations contained herein should be sufficient to give the reader a basic understanding of the theoretical developments.
 References to textbooks and the primary literature are provided for further reading.

Vectors and Tensors

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the concepts of vectors and tensors.
 This section summarizes the notation and some useful relations that will be used throughout the manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vectors are denoted by small,
 bold letters,
 e.g.
 
\series bold
v
\series default
.
 Their components will be denoted by 
\begin_inset space \quad{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 where,
 unless otherwise stated,
 Latin under scripts such as 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

will range from 1 to 3.
 In matrix form a vector will be represented as a column vector and its transpose as a row vector:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbf{v}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
v_{1}\\
v_{2}\\
v_{3}
\end{array}\right),\quad & \mathbf{v}^{T}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
v_{1}, & v_{2}, & v_{3}\end{array}\right)\end{array}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The following products are defined between vectors.
 Assume 
\series bold
u
\series default
,
 
\series bold
v
\series default
 are vectors.
 Also note that the Einstein summation convention is used throughout this manual

The

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}=u_{i}v_{i}\,.\label{eq2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\emph on

\emph default
:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_{2}v_{3}-u_{3}v_{2}\\
u_{3}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{3}\\
u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq3}

The 
\emph on

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}\right)_{ij}=u_{i}v_{j}\,.\label{eq4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that vectors are also known as first order tensors.
 Scalars are known as zero order tensors.
 The outer product,
 defined by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq4"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 is a second order tensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second order tensors are denoted by bold,
 capital letters,
 e.g.
 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset


\series default
.
 Some exceptions will be made to remain consistent with the literature.
 For instance,
 the Cauchy stress tensor is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 the nature of the objects will always be clear from the context.
 The following operations on tensors are defined.
 Assume 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
and 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
are second-order tensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
double contraction
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
tensor inner product
\emph default
 is defined as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}:\mathbf{B}=A_{ij}B_{ij}\,.\label{eq5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\emph on
trace
\emph default
 is defined as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tr\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I}:\mathbf{A}=A_{ii}\,.\label{eq6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 is the second order identity tensor with components 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general the components of tensors will change under a change of coordinate system.
 Nevertheless,
 certain intrinsic quantities associated with them will remain invariant under such a transformation.
 The scalar product between two vectors is such an example.
 The double contraction between two second-order tensors is another example.
 The following set of invariants for second-order tensors is commonly used:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}I_{1} & =\tr\mathbf{A},\\
I_{2} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(\tr\mathbf{A}\right)^{2}-\tr\mathbf{A}^{2}\right)\\
I_{3} & =\det\mathbf{A}.
\end{aligned}
\,.\label{eq7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
is called symmetric if it is equal to its transpose:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{S}^{T}\,.\label{eq8}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
is called anti-symmetric if it is equal to the negative of its transpose:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{W}=-\mathbf{W}^{T}\,.\label{eq9}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Any second order tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
can be written as the sum of a symmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset


\series bold
 
\series default
and an anti-symmetric tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset


\series default
:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{S}+\mathbf{W},\label{eq10}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{A}^{T}\right),\mbox{\thinspace and\thinspace}\mathbf{W}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A}^{T}\right).\label{eq11}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also note that for any tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
the following holds:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}:\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}:\mathbf{S}\,,\quad\mathbf{B}:\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{0}\,.\label{eq12}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

With any anti-symmetric tensor a dual vector 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
can be associated such that,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{u}\,,\label{eq13}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the second order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{w}}$
\end_inset

 is defined as,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{w}}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -w_{3} & w_{2}\\
w_{3} & 0 & -w_{1}\\
-w_{2} & w_{1} & 0
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq14}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A second order 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
tensor is called 
\emph on
orthogonal 
\emph default
if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{-1}=\mathbf{Q}^{T}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the implementation of the FE method it is often convenient to write symmetric second-order tensors using 
\emph on
Voigt notation
\emph default
.
 In this notation the components of a 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\mathrm{nd}}$
\end_inset

 order symmetric tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
are arranged as a column vector:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathbf{A}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
A_{11}\\
A_{22}\\
A_{33}\\
A_{12}\\
A_{23}\\
A_{13}
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq15}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Higher order tensors will be denoted by bold,
 capital,
 script symbols,
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}}$
\end_inset

.
 An example of a third-order tensor is the 
\emph on
permutation tensor 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{ijk}$
\end_inset

,
 whose components are 1 for an even permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3\right)$
\end_inset

,
 -1 for an odd permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3\right)$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 The permutation symbol is useful for expressing the cross-product of two vectors in index notation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}\right)_{i}=\mathcal{E}_{ijk}u_{j}v_{k}\,.\label{eq16}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

An example of a fourth-order tensor is the elasticity tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$
\end_inset

 which,
 in linear elasticity theory,
 relates the small strain tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}$
\end_inset

 and the Cauchy stress tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher order tensors can be constructed from second order tensors in a similar way as second order tensors can be constructed from vectors.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 are second order tensors,
 then the following fourth order tensors can be defind by requiring that the following must hold for any second order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{A}\otimes\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{X}=\left(\mathbf{B}:\mathbf{X}\right)\mathbf{A}\,,\label{eq17}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The governing equations of continuum mechanics are given by the axioms of conservation of mass,
 linear and angular momentum,
 and energy.
 These axioms produce differential equations that need to be solved for the material response.
 However,
 on their own,
 these equations are insufficient to solve for all the unknowns in an analysis,
 therefore we must also provide equations of state that describe the behavior of specific classes of materials,
 such as elastic solids,
 viscoelastic solids,
 viscous fluids,
 etc.
 These equations of state are formulated as constitutive models,
 which may not be chosen arbitrarily:
 they must be constrained by the axiom of entropy inequality.
 In this section,
 we summarize all the axioms of conservation for a pure substance,
 as well as the axiom of entropy inequality.

Axiom of Mass Balance

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axiom of mass balance simply states that mass is conserved,
 or equivalently,
 its time rate of change is zero.
 Normally,
 we formulate this axiom in a volumetric domain (such as a fixed control volume with permeable boundary,
 a material region with impermeable boundary,
 or a material region with permeable boundary),
 then convert it to its differential form.
 In a spatial (Eulerian) frame,
 the differential statement of the axiom of mass balance takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\divg\left(\rho\mathbf{v}\right)=0\,,\label{eq:axiom-mass-balance}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the mass density of the matter and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is its velocity vector.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\divg\left(\rho\mathbf{v}\right)=\grad\rho\cdot\mathbf{v}+\rho\divg\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 we may also write this relation in the form
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axioms of linear and angular momentum balance are also known as Newton's second law of motion.
 The axiom of linear momentum balance states that the time rate of change of linear momentum is equal to the sum of all surface and body forces.
 The differential statement of the axiom of mass balance in a spatial frame is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\frac{D\mathbf{v}}{Dt}=\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}+\rho\mathbf{b}\,,\label{eq:axiom-linear-momentum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 is the Cauchy stress tensor in the material,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the specific body force vector (body force per mass),
 which is typically prescribed.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $D\mathbf{v}/Dt$
\end_inset

 is the acceleration of the matter at every point in the continuum,
 as evaluated in the spatial frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axiom of angular momentum balance states that the time rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the sum of all surface and body moments.
 The angular momentum represents the moment of the linear momentum about a fixed point (such as the origin) in an inertial frame.
 In a 
\emph on

 we assume that moments are only produces by surface and body forces.
 In that case,
 the axiom of angular momentum balance is satisfied by the linear momentum balance

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axiom of energy balance is also known as the first law of thermodynamics.
 The time rate of change of internal and kinetic energy is balanced by the rate of work done by body and surface forces,
 the rate of heat flow into the medium,
 and rate of heat supply from external sources.
 Its differential statement takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\frac{D\varepsilon}{Dt}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{L}-\divg\mathbf{q}+\rho r\,,\label{eq:axiom-energy-balance}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 is the specific internal energy (internal energy per mass),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}=\grad\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity gradient,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is the heat flux in the medium (units of power per area),
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

Axiom of Entropy Inequality
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The axioms of conservation presented above have introduced several functions of state that describe the behavior of specific materials,
 such as the Cauchy stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

,
 the specific internal energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

,
 and the heat flux 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

.
 These axioms of conservation have a total of ten scalar unknowns (six compoments of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

,
 three components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

),
 whereas the equations have five scalar components (three components of the vectorial linear momentum balance,
 and one component for each of the scalar mass and energy balance equations).
 Therefore,
 there are too few equations to solve for all the unknowns.
 Consequently,
 constitutive models must be provided for these functions of state,
 which depend on a user-specified set of state variables (such as strain for elastic solids,
 rate of deformation for viscous fluids,
 temperature for heat transfer,
 etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constitutive relations must be formulated in a manner that does not violate the axiom of entropy inequality,
 also known as the second law of thermodynamics.
 The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that the time rate of change of entropy in a medium is greater than the rate of entropy supply into the medium by various sources of heat.
 In a spatial frame,
 the differential statement of the axiom of entropy inequality is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\frac{D\eta}{Dt}+\divg\frac{\mathbf{q}}{\theta}-\rho\frac{r}{\theta}\geqslant0\,,\label{eq:axiom-entropy-inequality}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the specific entropy (entropy per unit mass) of the matter.
 Entropy is a measure of disorder in a medium.
 It represents another function of state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:axiom-entropy-inequality"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 does not include all of the functions of state,
 we may combine it with the energy balance to recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 in the entropy inequality.
 This may be achived by multiplying the entropy inequality in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:axiom-entropy-inequality"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 by the absolute temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is always positive) and adding it to the energy balance in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:axiom-energy-balance"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\rho\left(\frac{D\varepsilon}{Dt}-\theta\frac{D\eta}{Dt}\right)+\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D}-\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q}\cdot\grad\theta\geqslant0\,.
\]

\end_inset

The term in parentheses may be rearranged as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{D\varepsilon}{Dt}-\theta\frac{D\eta}{Dt}=\frac{D}{Dt}\left(\varepsilon-\theta\eta\right)+\eta\frac{D\theta}{Dt}\,.
\]

\end_inset

We now introduce the specific Helmholtz free energy,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

,
 which relates the specific internal energy and entropy according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\psi=\varepsilon-\theta\eta\,.\label{eq:specific-free-energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We may say that the free energy is the part of the internal energy which is available to produce useful work.
 Substituting this expression above produces the form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality that involves all the independent functions of state appearing in these axioms,
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

),
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\rho\left(\dot{\psi}+\eta\dot{\theta}\right)+\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D}-\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q}\cdot\grad\theta\geqslant0\,,\label{eq:Clausius-Duhem-inequality}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we have substituted 
\begin_inset Formula $D\left(\cdot\right)/Dt$
\end_inset

 with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\dot{}\right)$
\end_inset

 operator,
 for notational simplicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understant that all functions of state are non-observable properties of matter:
 No instruments exist to measure the complete state of stress inside a material,
 nor the heat flux,
 the internal energy,
 or the entropy.
 However,
 we can formulate constitutive models that relate these functions of state to observable state variables,
 then calculate their value for a specific state.
 Observable state variables are all based on measurements of space (length,
 area and volume) and time.
 For example,
 we can measure (observe) displacement,
 velocity and acceleration of matter at various spatial locations,
 from which we can calculate their spatial gradients and treat these as observable state variables.
 From measurements of length in calibrated materials,
 we can derive measurements of force (using a load cell) and temperature (using a thermometer).

Therefore,
 the velocity

\end_inset

The material time derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 in the spatial frame may be evaluated by using the chain rule on 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\tilde{f}\left(\mathbf{x},t\right)\equiv f\left(\boldsymbol{\chi}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right),t\right)$

 thus
\begin_inset Formula

 and recognizing that

 this expression may be rewritten as

\end_inset

We used the operator

 the deformation gradient may be decomposed uniquely into
\begin_inset Formula

\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{R}\label{eq:polar-decomposition-RU}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$

 is a proper orthogonal transformation (a rotation,

 It follows from this decomposition that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{R}\cdot\left(\mathbf{U}\cdot d\mathbf{X}\right)$
\end_inset

 may be viewed as a stretching of

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$

 followed by a rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$

 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{V}\cdot\left(\mathbf{R}\cdot d\mathbf{X}\right)$

 is the rotation of 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{X}$

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{F}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{U}^{2}$

 it follows that the eigenvalues of

 are the square of the eigenvalues of

 these eigenvalues provide a measure of the stretch,
 not a measure of the rotation.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}$

 also share the same eigenvectors.
 Thus,

In the case of rigid body motion (translation and/or rotation,

 Just as in the case of the stress tensor,

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 is also an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{v}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{I}\right)\cdot\mathbf{v}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\lambda^{2}-1\right)\mathbf{v}\label{eq84-1}

Therefore the corresponding eigenvalue of

 which also established the relation between the normal components of

 The shear components of

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\dot{\lambda}_{m}}{\lambda_{m}}+\frac{\dot{\lambda}_{n}}{\lambda_{n}}\right)\sin\gamma+\frac{\dot{\gamma}}{2}\cos\gamma\label{eq85j}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We now consider two cases:
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}=\mathbf{n}$

 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\pi/2$

D_{nn}\equiv\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\frac{\dot{\lambda}_{n}}{\lambda_{n}}\,.\label{eq:D-normal}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In other words,
 the normal component of the rate of deformation tensor along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is the rate of stretch per stretch of a differential line element along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$

\begin{equation}

Thus,
 the shear component of

\end_inset

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 These functions could depend on a number of

For the purpose of modeling elastic solids under isothermal conditions,
 we would like to restrict our constitutive models to be independent of the temperature or its gradient.
 For an elastic solid,
 the rate of load application does not have an effect;
 therefore,
 there should be no dependency on the rate of deformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 for an elastic solid,
 upon removal of the loading,
 deformations should disappear completely.
 This implies that there should be no dependence on the history (or path) of loading,
 only on the current state of loading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these restrictions,
 we assume that the non-observable functions of state

 depend only on the observable solid matrix strain,
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the principle of equipresence,
 all functions of state depend only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 In particular,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the only function of state which is differentiated with respect to time in the Clausius-Duhem inequality,
 eq.

 we express it explicitly as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\psi=\psi\left(\mathbf{E}\right)\,.\label{eq95-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given this dependence,
 we can use the chain rule of differentiation to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\psi}=\frac{d\psi}{d\mathbf{E}}:\dot{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{d\psi}{d\mathbf{E}}:\mathbf{F}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathbf{F}\label{eq96-1}

 Making use of the identity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\psi}{d\mathbf{E}}:\mathbf{F}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}\cdot\frac{d\psi}{d\mathbf{E}}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{T}:\mathbf{D}\label{eq100-1}

\end_inset

 we find that the entropy inequality reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\rho\eta\dot{\theta}-\frac{1}{\theta}\mathbf{q}\cdot\grad\theta+\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}-\rho\mathbf{F}\cdot\frac{d\psi}{d\mathbf{E}}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{T}\right):\mathbf{D}\geqslant0\label{eq101-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This inequality must hold for arbitrary processes,
 i.e.,
 for arbitrary changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\grad\theta$
\end_inset

 (all of which are independent,
 observable variables of state),
 under our self-imposed constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 only depend on the state variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 For example,
 since the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in the leftmost term of eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 may either increase or decrease at various times in any process,
 the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

 may be variably positive or negative.
 However,
 the sign of the product 
\begin_inset Formula $-\rho\eta\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

 may not be set strictly positive since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\eta$
\end_inset

 does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 The same argument applies to the remaining terms in the entropy inequality,
 each of which may vary independently of other terms.
 Therefore,
 the only way that the entropy inequality may be satisfied for arbitrary processes,
 given our choice of state variables,
 is to have each term be independently equal to zero.
 Thus,
 the entropy inequality requires that

This formula represents the constraint imposed by the second law of thermodynamics on the formulation of a constitutive relation for an elastic solid.
 For historical reasons,
 this formula is described as the

hyperelasticity

 constraint.
 The method described for obtaining this formula was first proposed by Coleman and Noll in 1963

.
 Prior to that formulation,
 other constitutive relations had been proposed for elastic solids (such as hypoelasticity),
 though it is now believed that the only thermodynamically valid formulation is the one given here.

\end_inset

,
 which describes the local fiber direction in the undeformed configuration.
 When the material undergoes deformation,
 the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)$
\end_inset

 may be described by a unit vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\left(\boldsymbol{\varphi}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In general,
 the fibers will also undergo length change.
 The fiber stretch,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

,
 can be determined in terms of the deformation gradient and the fiber direction in the undeformed configuration,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{A}\,.\label{eq95}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is a unit vector,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda^{2}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{A}\,.\label{eq96}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The strain energy function for a transversely isotropic material,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi\left(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X}\right)$
\end_inset

 is an isotropic function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}\otimes\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

.
 It can be shown 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Spencer84"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that the following set of invariants are sufficient to describe the material fully:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{1}=\tr\mathbf{C}\,,\quad I_{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\tr\mathbf{C}\right)^{2}-\tr\mathbf{C}^{2}\right]\,,\quad I_{3}=\det C=J^{2}\,,\label{eq97}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{4}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{A}\,,\quad I_{5}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{C}^{2}\cdot\mathbf{A}\,.\label{eq98}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The strain energy function can be written in terms of these invariants such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi\left(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X}\right)=\Psi\left(I_{1}\left(\mathbf{C}\right),I_{2}\left(\mathbf{C}\right),I_{3}\left(\mathbf{C}\right),I_{4}\left(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{A}\right),I_{5}\left(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{A}\right)\right)\,.\label{eq99}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The second Piola-Kirchhoff can now be obtained in the standard manner:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}=2\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\mathbf{C}}=2\sum\limits_{i=1}^{5}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial I_{i}}\frac{\partial I_{i}}{\partial\mathbf{C}}\,.\label{eq100}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

nolink "false"

\end_inset

 it is further assumed that the strain energy function can be split into the following terms:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi\left(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{A}\right)=\Psi_{1}\left(I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}\right)+\Psi_{2}\left(I_{4}\right)+\Psi_{3}\left(I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}I_{4}\right)\,.\label{eq101}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The strain energy function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 represents the material response of the isotropic ground substance matrix,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 represents the contribution from the fiber family (e.g.
 collagen),
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{3}$
\end_inset

 is the contribution from interactions between the fibers and matrix.
 The form

.
 While this relation represents a large simplification when compared to the general case,
 it also embodies almost all of the material behavior that one would expect from transversely isotropic,
 large deformation matrix-fiber composites.

When dealing with incompressible and nearly incompressible materials,
 it proves useful to separate the volumetric and the deviatoric (distortional) components of the deformation gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 Such a separation must ensure that the deviatoric part of the deformation gradient,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{F}}$

,
 does not produce any change in volume.
 Noting that the determinant of the deformation gradient gives the volume ratio,
 the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tilde{F}}$
\end_inset

 must therefore satisfy,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\det\mathbf{\tilde{F}}=1\,.\label{eq38}

This condition can be achieved by choosing

 Typically,
 such fibers are represented with a strain energy density function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$

 ensures that the fiber contributes strain energy only when it is under tension (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}>1$
\end_inset

);
 thus,
 the constitutive model 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{n}\left(I_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 for the tensile response of the fiber must reduce to zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}=1$

Using the hyperelasticity relations presented above,
 the Cauchy stress in this fiber material can be evaluated as

If we denote the unit vector along the fiber in the current configuration as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\equiv I_{n}^{-1/2}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}$

 the above expressions may be rewritten as

\begin_layout Standard
Biphasic materials may be used to model deformable porous media.
 A biphasic material represents a mixture of a porous permeable solid and an interstitial fluid.
 Each constituent is intrinsically incompressible,
 but the mixture may change volume as interstitial fluid is exchanged with the pore space of the solid.
 Biphasic materials require the explicit modeling of fluid that permeates the solid.
 The biphasic material model is useful to simulate materials that show flow-dependent viscoelastic behavior resulting from the frictional interactions of the fluid and solid.
 Several biological materials such as cartilage can be described more accurately this way.

The governing equations that enter into the statement of virtual work are the conservation of linear momentum and the conservation of mass,
 for the mixture as a whole.
 Under quasi-static conditions,
 the conservation of momentum reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}+\rho\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{0}\,,\label{eq103}
\end{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 is the Cauchy stress for the mixture,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the mixture density and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the external mixture body force per mass.
 Since the mixture is porous,
 this stress may also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the fluid pressure and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{e}$
\end_inset

 is the effective or extra stress,
 resulting from the deformation of the solid matrix.
 Conservation of mass for the mixture requires that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
To relate the relative fluid flux

 it is necessary to employ the equation of conservation of linear momentum for the fluid,

\begin{equation}
-\varphi^{w}\grad p+\rho^{w}\mathbf{b}^{w}+\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{d}^{w}=\mathbf{0}\,,\label{eq106}

\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{w}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{w}$
\end_inset

 is the true fluid density,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{w}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{d}^{w}$

 is the momentum exchange between the solid and fluid constituents,
 typically representing the frictional interaction between these constituents.
 This equation neglects the viscous stress of the fluid in comparison to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{d}^{w}$

 The most common constitutive relation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{p}}_{d}^{w}=-\varphi^{w}\mathbf{k}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{w}$

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental modeling assumptions adopted in this treatment are quasi-static conditions for momentum balance (negligible effects of inertia),
 intrinsic incompressibility of all constituents (invariant true densities),
 isothermal conditions,
 negligible volume fraction of solute relative to the solid and solvent,
 and negligible effects of solute and solvent viscosities (friction within constituents) relative to frictional interactions between constituents.
 These assumptions are often made in studies of biological tissues and cells.
 External body forces and chemical reactions are not considered.
\end_layout

The three constituents of the mixture are the porous-permeable solid matrix (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=s)$
\end_inset

,
 the solvent (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=w)$
\end_inset

,
 and the solute (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=u)$
\end_inset

.
 The motion of the solid matrix is described by the displacement vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

,
 the pressure of the interstitial fluid (solvent
\begin_inset Formula $+$

solute) is 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

,
 and the solute concentration (on a solution-volume basis) is 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 The total (or mixture) stress may be described by the Cauchy stress tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 is the identity tensor and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$
\end_inset

 is the stress arising from the strain in the porous solid matrix.
 Because it is porous,
 the solid matrix is compressible since the volume of pores changes as interstitial fluid enters or leaves the matrix.
 Under the conditions outlined above,
 the balance of linear momentum for the mixture reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}=-\grad p+\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}=\mathbf{0}\,.\label{eq108}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly,
 the equations of balance of linear momentum for the solvent and solute are given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\rho^{w}\grad\tilde{\mu}^{w}+\mathbf{f}^{ws}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}-\mathbf{v}^{w}\right)+\mathbf{f}^{wu}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{u}-\mathbf{v}^{w}\right) & =\mathbf{0}\,,\\

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the apparent density (mass of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 per volume of the mixture),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the mechano-chemical potential and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the diffusive drag tensor between constituents 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 representing momentum exchange via frictional interactions,
 which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{\beta\alpha}=\mathbf{f}^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 An important feature of these relations is the incorporation of momentum exchange term between the solute and solid matrix,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{us}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}-\mathbf{v}^{u}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 which is often neglected in other treatments but plays an important role for describing solid-solute interactions

 These momentum equations show that the driving force for the transport of solvent or solute is the gradient in its mechano-chemical potential,
 which is resisted by frictional interactions with other constituents.

It is also necessary to satisfy the balance of mass for each of the constituents.
 In the absence of chemical reactions,
 the statement of balance of mass for constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho^{\alpha}}{\partial t}+\divg\left(\rho^{\alpha}\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}\right)=0\,.\label{eq111}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The apparent density may be related to the true density via 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}=\varphi^{\alpha}\rho_{T}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the volume fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in the mixture.
 Due to mixture saturation (no voids),
 the volume fractions add up to unity.
 Since the volume fraction of solute is considered negligible (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{u}\ll\varphi^{s},\varphi^{w})$
\end_inset

,
 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\nolimits_{\alpha}\varphi^{\alpha}\approx\varphi^{s}+\varphi^{w}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 of an incompressible constituent is invariant in space and time,
 these relations may be combined to produce the mixture balance of mass relation,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}\right)=0,\label{eq112}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}=\varphi^{w}\left(\mathbf{v}^{w}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the volumetric flux of solvent relative to the solid.
 The balance of mass for the solute may also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\left(\varphi^{w}c\right)}{\partial t}+\divg\left(\mathbf{j}+\varphi^{w}c\,\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)=0\,,\label{eq113}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}=\varphi^{w}c\left(\mathbf{v}^{u}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the molar flux of solute relative to the solid.
 This mass balance relation is obtained by recognizing that the solute apparent density (mass per mixture volume) is related to its concentration (moles per solution volume) via 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{u}=\left(1-\varphi^{s}\right)Mc\approx\varphi^{w}Mc$
\end_inset

.
 Finally,
 it can be shown via standard arguments that the mass balance for the solid matrix reduces to

 Solving these equations requires the application of suitable boundary conditions that are consistent with mass,

 When defining boundaries or interfaces on the solid matrix (the conventional approach in solid mechanics),
 whose outward unit normal is

 the mechano-chemical potentials do not represent practical choices for primary variables in a finite element implementation.
 An examination of

 Therefore,

Multiphasic materials represent an extension of the biphasic-solute material,
 where the mixture may contain a multitude of solutes.
 These solutes may be either electrically charged (ionized) or neutral.
 Similarly,
 the solid matrix may either carry electrical charge (a fixed charge density) or be neutral.
 A triphasic material is a special case of a multiphasic material,
 having two solutes that carry opposite charges.
 Triphasic and multiphasic materials may be used to model porous deformable biological tissues whose solid matrix may be charged and whose interstitial fluid may contain any number of charged or neutral solutes.
 When mixture constituents are electrically charged,
 the response of the tissue to various loading conditions may encompass a range of mechano-electrochemical phenomena,
 including permeation,
 diffusion,
 osmosis,
 streaming potentials and streaming currents.
 To better understand multiphasic materials,
 the reader is encouraged to review the descriptions of biphasic (Section

In multiphasic materials the solvent is assumed to be neutral,
 whereas the solid and solutes may carry charge.
 The mixture is isothermal and all constituents are considered to be intrinsically incompressible.
 Since the viscosity of the fluid constituents (solvent and solutes) is considered negligible relative to the frictional interactions among constituents,
 the stress tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for the mixture includes only a contribution from the fluid pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 and the stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$

 in the solid,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}\,.\label{eq121}

The mechano-chemical potential of the solvent is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mu}^{w}=\mu_{0}^{w}\left(\theta\right)+\frac{1}{\rho_{T}^{w}}\left(p-p_{0}-R\theta\Phi\sum\limits_{\alpha}c^{\alpha}\right)\,,\label{eq122}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}^{w}\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

 is the solvent chemical potential in the solvent standard state,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the absolute temperature,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{w}$
\end_inset

 is the true density of the solvent (which is invariant since the solvent is assumed intrinsically incompressible),
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the fluid pressure,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the corresponding pressure in the standard state,
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

\begin_inset Formula $c^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the solution volume-based concentration of solute 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 The summation is taken over all solutes in the mixture.
 The mechano-electrochemical potential of each solute is similarly given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mu}^{\alpha}=\mu_{0}^{\alpha}\left(\theta\right)+\frac{R\theta}{M^{\alpha}}\left(\frac{z^{\alpha}F_{c}}{R\theta}\left(\psi-\psi_{0}\right)+\ln\frac{\gamma^{\alpha}c^{\alpha}}{\kappa^{\alpha}c_{0}^{\alpha}}\right),\label{eq123}

\begin_inset Formula $M^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $z^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

In these relations,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 represents the fraction of the pore volume which may be occupied by solute 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 The standard state represents an arbitrary set of reference conditions for the physico-chemical state of each constituent.
 Therefore,
 the values of

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{\alpha}$

 appear together as a ratio,
 they may be combined into a single material function,

\begin_layout Standard
In multiphasic mixtures,
 it is also assumed that electroneutrality is satisfied at every point in the continuum.
 Therefore,
 the net electrical charge summed over all constituents must reduce to zero,
 and no net charge accumulation may occur at any time.
 Denoting the fixed charge density of the solid by 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{F}$
\end_inset

 (moles of equivalent charge per solution volume),
 and recognizing that the solvent is always considered neutral,
 the electroneutrality condition may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c^{F}+\sum\limits_{\alpha}z^{\alpha}c^{\alpha}=0\,.\label{eq124}

This condition represents a constraint on a mixture of charged constituents.
 If none of the constituents are charged (
\begin_inset Formula $c^{F}=0$

Each constituent of the mixture must satisfy the axiom of mass balance.
 In the absence of chemical reactions involving constituent

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}$

 For solutes,
 the apparent density is related to the concentration according to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}=\left(1-\varphi^{s}\right)M^{\alpha}c^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the volume fraction of the solid.
 When the solute volume fractions are negligible,
 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\varphi^{s}\approx\varphi^{w}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{w}$
\end_inset

 is the solvent volume fraction.
 The molar flux of the solute relative to the solid is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}^{\alpha}=\varphi^{w}c^{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the solute velocity.
 Using these relations,
 the mass balance relation for the solute may be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $J=\det\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$

 This form of the mass balance for the solute is convenient for a finite element formulation where the mesh is defined on the solid matrix.

 When solute volume fractions are negligible,

Finally,
 the mass balance for the solid may be reduced to the form

\begin_layout Standard
In FEBio the referential strain energy density for any solid mixture constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is evaluated from the same library of constitutive models used in single-constituent solids.
 In this library the calculation of the referential strain energy density is based on the assumption that the reference configuration corresponds to the configuration when the deformation gradient passed to those functions is equal to the identity tensor.
 Thus,
 passing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}$
\end_inset

 to those functions returns the correct 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{r}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 when passing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 as an argument to those functions,
 the referential volume is based on the configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 Let the referential free energy density returned by FEBio for an argument 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{0}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 We may similarly denote the corresponding Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensors by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_{0}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 Here,
 the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 has two meanings:
 First it emphasizes that the corresponding function is evaluated using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 for the mixture constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

;
 second it emphasizes that the calculation returns the corresponding measure under the assumption that the mixture consists entirely of that constituent,
 so that its multiplication by the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 returns the actual contribution of that measure to the entire mixture.
 Based on eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{r}^{\sigma}=J^{\sigma s}\Psi_{0}^{\sigma}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{r}=\sum_{\sigma}w^{\sigma}J^{\sigma s}\Psi_{0}^{\sigma}\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right)\,,\label{eq:febio-mixture-sed}

\end_inset

whereas the mixture Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\sum_{\sigma}w^{\sigma}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{\sigma}\,,\quad\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}=\sum_{\sigma}w^{\sigma}\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_{0}^{\sigma}\,,\label{eq:febio-mixture-stress}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{\sigma}=\frac{1}{J^{\sigma}}\frac{\partial\Psi_{0}^{\sigma}}{\partial\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right)^{T}=\frac{1}{J^{s}}\frac{\partial\Psi_{r}^{\sigma}}{\partial\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right)^{T}\label{eq:febio-stress-function}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_{0}^{\sigma}=\frac{4}{J^{\sigma}}\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\oslash\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right):\frac{\partial^{2}\Psi_{0}^{\sigma}}{\partial\mathbf{C}^{\sigma}\partial\mathbf{C}^{\sigma}}:\left(\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right)^{T}\oslash\left(\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\right)^{T}\right)\,.\label{eq:febio-elasticity-function}

These relations show that the Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensor of constituent

\begin_inset Formula

When using the reference configuration

It can be shown that these stresses are related according to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

Multigenerational interstitial growth mechanics may be modeled using a reactive mixture of constrained solids as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In this framework it is assumed that a porous solid matrix may gain mass via interstitial growth,
 such that the porosity of the solid decreases with increasing solid mass content.
 The history of growth is discretized temporally into generations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 such that the mass added in the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\sigma}\le t<t^{\sigma+1}$
\end_inset

 has a reference configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 This model assumes that each generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 gets deposited into the existing mixture in a stress-free state.
 This can be achieved by adopting the constitutive assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{\chi}^{s}\left(\mathbf{X}^{s},t^{\sigma}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In other words,
 the reference configuration of generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the current configuration of the solid mixture at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 An alternative form of this constitutive model,
 which satisfies frame-indifference,
 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma}\left(\mathbf{X}^{s},t^{\sigma}\right)=\mathbf{R}^{s}\left(\mathbf{X}^{s},t^{\sigma}\right)$
\end_inset

 at the time the new generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is being deposited,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the rotation tensor in the polar decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}=\mathbf{R}^{s}\cdot\mathbf{U}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma s}\left(\mathbf{X}^{s}\right)=\mathbf{U}^{s}\left(\mathbf{X}^{s},t^{\sigma}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $t^{\sigma}$

 and the properties of the material of each generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 The code automatically prescribes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma s}$
\end_inset

 based on the constitutive model given above,
 for each generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 For example,
 one may use a material model whose response depends on the evolving composition 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 of that generation.
 The composition 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 may evolve either due to chemical reactions modeled in a multiphasic framework,
 or by associating a user-defined load curve with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 the material properties (and the stress response) of generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 need not remain constant over the generation time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\sigma}\le t<t^{\sigma+1}$
\end_inset

 even though 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma s}$
\end_inset

 remains constant during that generation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the growth process is negative (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}_{r}^{\sigma}<0$
\end_inset

 it implies that the solid constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is losing mass (solid resorption);
 this loss of mass terminates when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}=0$
\end_inset

 A material model that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}$

 may exhibit evolving material properties during this resorption process until that generation produces zero stress when 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\sigma}=0$

An alternative approach to multigenerational growth is to prescribe

 in general,

 though this model can be specialized to transversely isotropic stretch by setting two of these stretch ratios equal to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At lower symmetries the constitutive model for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{\sigma s}$

 For monoclinic materials,

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}$

 In this case,
\begin_inset Formula

 the polar decomposition theorem shows that this deformation gradient is not a pure stretch,

When the interstitial fluid of a porous medium contains one or more solutes,
 an osmotic pressure may be produced in the fluid if the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid is non-uniform,
 or if it is different from that of the external bathing solution surrounding the porous medium.
 In general,
 since the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid may vary over time in transient problems,
 the analysis of such swelling effects may be addressed using,

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$

 When steady-state conditions are achieved,
 the fluid pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 results exclusively from osmotic effects and ambient conditions (i.e.,
 it does not depend on the loading history).
 Thus,
 in analogy to eq.

The osmotic pressure

 Neither

 This relation shows that the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid is dependent on the relative change in volume of the solid matrix with deformation.

 the term

 if we assume that

 we may thus state generically that

 Since the boundary is permeable to the solvent,

 Assuming ideal physicochemical conditions,

 The boundaries of the medium are permeable to the solvent and ions.
 The fixed charge density is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{F}$
\end_inset

;
 it is a measure of the number of fixed charges per volume of the interstitial fluid in the current configuration.
 This charge density may be either negative or positive,
 thereby producing an imbalance in the concentration of anions and cations in the interstitial fluid.
 To determine the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid,
 it is necessary to equate the mechano-chemical potential of the solvent and the mechano-electrochemical potential of the ions between the porous medium and its surrounding bath.
 When assuming ideal physicochemical behavior,
 the interstitial osmolarity (resulting from the interstitial ions) is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\sqrt{\left(c^{F}\right)^{2}+\left(2c^{\ast}\right)^{2}}\,,\label{eq147}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 is the salt concentration in the bath.
 Alternatively,
 we note that the osmolarity of the bath is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}^{\ast}=2c^{\ast}$
\end_inset

.
 Though this expression may be equated with eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
 the resulting value of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r}$
\end_inset

 is not constant in this case,
 since ions may transport into or out of the pore space;
 therefore that relation is not useful here.
\end_layout

However,
 since the number of charges fixed to the solid matrix is invariant,
 we may manipulate eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to produce a relation between the fixed charge density in the current configuration,

\begin{equation}
c^{F}=\frac{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}c_{r}^{F}\,.\label{eq148}

\end_inset

Now the osmotic pressure resulting from the difference in osmolarity between the porous medium and its surrounding bath is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p=R\theta\left(\sqrt{\left(\frac{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}c_{r}^{F}\right)^{2}+\left(\bar{c}^{\ast}\right)^{2}}-\bar{c}^{\ast}\right)\,.\label{eq149}

 this parameter represents a direct measure of the mass content of

 A distinction is now made between solid and solute species in the mixture,

\begin_layout Standard
The various constituents of the porous solid matrix of a multiphasic mixture may be electrically charged.
 The charge density in the current configuration,
 normalized by the mixture volume in the current configuration,
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\check{c}^{F}=\frac{z^{F}dn^{F}+\sum_{\sigma}z^{\sigma}dn^{\sigma}}{dV}\,,\label{eq:FCD-mixture-volume}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{F}$
\end_inset

 is the charge number (equivalent charge per mole) and 
\begin_inset Formula $dn^{F}$
\end_inset

 is the elemental number of moles associated with fixed charges present in the initial volume fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{0}^{s}$
\end_inset

 of the solid matrix.
 Similarly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 is the charge number of evolving solid constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 By convention however,
 the fixed charge density 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{F}$
\end_inset

 of a multiphasic material is normalized by the fluid volume of the mixture,
 thus it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c^{F}=\frac{\check{c}^{F}}{1-\varphi^{s}}=\frac{1}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}\left(\frac{z^{F}dn^{F}}{dV_{r}}+\sum_{\sigma}\frac{z^{\sigma}\rho_{r}^{\sigma}}{M^{\sigma}}\right)\,.\label{eq:FCD-fluid-volume}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular,
 in the reference configuration this formula produces
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c^{F}\left(0\right)=\frac{1}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}\left(\frac{z^{F}dn^{F}\left(0\right)}{dV_{r}}+\sum_{\sigma}\frac{z^{\sigma}\rho_{r}^{\sigma}\left(0\right)}{M^{\sigma}}\right)\,.\label{eq:FCD-initial-time}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We define the first term on the right-hand-side of this equation as the initial value of the user-specified fixed charge density 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}^{F}$
\end_inset

 (which is not associated with solid species 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{0}^{F}\equiv\frac{1}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}\frac{z^{F}dn^{F}\left(0\right)}{dV_{r}}\,.\label{eq:user-specified-cF0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore,
 in the current configuration,
 we may rewrite
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c^{F}=\frac{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}c_{0}^{F}+\frac{1}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}\sum_{\sigma}\frac{z^{\sigma}\rho_{r}^{\sigma}}{M^{\sigma}}\,.\label{eq158}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the user-specified 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}^{F}$
\end_inset

 may optionally be associated with a load curve representing the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $dn^{F}/dn^{F}\left(0\right)$
\end_inset

,
 in case the user would like to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}^{F}$
\end_inset

 to evolve.
 By analogy,
 we may now define the referential fixed-charge density 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r}^{F}$
\end_inset

 of the mixture as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{r}^{F}\equiv\frac{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}c^{F}=c_{0}^{F}+\frac{1}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}\sum_{\sigma}\frac{z^{\sigma}\rho_{r}^{\sigma}}{M^{\sigma}}\label{eq157}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r}^{F}$
\end_inset

 may evolve with time,
 but it represents the number of fixed equivalent charges in the current configuration,
 per fluid volume in the reference configuration.
 Hence we may also write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c^{F}=\frac{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\left(0\right)}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}c_{r}^{F}\,.
\]

An alternative to using solid-bound molecules is to define solutes 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 whose diffusivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 in the mixture is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 (however,
 the free diffusivity 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 should not be set to zero,
 to prevent a division by zero;
 its exact value is not important,
 thus let 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}^{\sigma}=1$
\end_inset

).
 Then,
 FEBio treats these solutes as equivalent to solid-bound molecules:
 (1) Their concentration does not contribute to the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid;
 (2) their concentration contributes to the fixed charge density 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{F}$
\end_inset

 in the current configuration;
 (3) these solutes do not contribute to the effective hydraulic permeability 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{k}}$
\end_inset

 of the porous multiphasic mixture;
 (4) these solutes can be involved in chemical reactions;
 (5) while their initial effective concentration may be prescribed,
 it must not contribute to the prescribed initial effective fluid pressure,
 and the user should not prescribe any boundary conditions on the effective concentration of these solutes.
 Using these 'solid-bound' solutes increases the number of degrees of freedom in an FEBio analysis;
 however,
 unlike solid-bound molecules,
 the solution for the effective concentration of these solutes remains as accurate as all other degrees of freedom in an analysis.

\end_inset

This mass balance relation for the mixture expresses the fact that the mixture volume will change as a result of chemical reactions where the true density of products is different from that of reactants.
 Indeed,
 assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the same for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 would nullify the right-hand-side of eq.

 based on eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 We now adopt the assumption that solutes occupy a negligible volume fraction of the mixture (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{\iota}\ll1)$
\end_inset

,
 from which it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{s}+\varphi^{w}\approx1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\limits_{\alpha}\varphi^{\alpha}\mathbf{v}^{\alpha}\approx\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}=\varphi^{w}\left(\mathbf{v}^{w}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the volumetrix flux of solvent relative to the solid.
 Thus,
 the mixture mass balance may be reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}\right)=\sum\limits_{\alpha}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}\,.\label{eq163}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the special case of the solvent (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=w$
\end_inset

),
 FEBio uses a solvent supply,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\varphi}^{w}=\hat{\rho}^{w}/\hat{\rho}_{T}^{w}$
\end_inset

,
 which may be incorporated in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}\right)=\hat{\varphi}^{w}+\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}\,.\label{eq163b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the mass balance equation for the solvent we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\hat{\varphi}^{w} & =\frac{D^{s}\varphi^{w}}{Dt}+\grad\varphi^{w}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{w}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)+\varphi^{w}\divg\mathbf{v}^{w}\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

so that the mixture mass balance takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\divg\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}\right) & =\frac{D^{s}\varphi^{w}}{Dt}+\grad\varphi^{w}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{w}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)+\varphi^{w}\divg\mathbf{v}^{w}+\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}\,\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{w}+\varphi^{s}=1$
\end_inset

 this relation further simplifies to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi^{s}\divg\mathbf{v}^{s}+\frac{D^{s}\varphi^{s}}{Dt}=\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Now we use the kinematic relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\divg\mathbf{v}^{s}=\frac{1}{J}\frac{D^{s}J}{Dt}$
\end_inset

 to reduce this equation further to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{D^{s}\left(J\varphi^{s}\right)}{Dt}=J\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}\,.
\]

\end_inset

But recall that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J\varphi^{s}=\varphi_{r}^{s}
\]

\end_inset

thus the mixture mass balance now simplifies to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{J}\frac{D^{s}\varphi_{r}^{s}}{Dt}=\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}
\]

\end_inset

Since
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\rho}^{\alpha}=\left(1-\varphi^{s}\right)M^{\alpha}\hat{c}^{\alpha}
\]

\end_inset

it follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{D^{s}\varphi_{r}^{s}}{Dt}=J\left(1-\varphi^{s}\right)\sum\limits_{\alpha\ne w}\frac{M^{\alpha}\hat{c}^{\alpha}}{\rho_{T}^{\alpha}}
\]

\end_inset

Another way of presenting these results is to restate the mixture mass balance as

Productions rates are described by constitutive relations which are functions of the state variables.
 In a biological mixture under isothermal conditions,
 the minimum set of state variables needed to describe reactive mixtures that include a solid matrix are:
 the (uniform) temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

,
 the solid matrix deformation gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 (or related strain measures),
 and the molar content 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 of the various constituents.
 This set differs from the classical treatment of chemical kinetics in fluid mixtures by the inclusion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 and the subset of constituents bound to the solid matrix.
 To maintain a consistent notation in this section,
 solid-bound molecular species are described by their molar concentrations and molar supplies which may be related to their referential mass density and referential mass supply according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c^{\sigma}=\frac{\rho_{r}^{\sigma}}{\left(J-\varphi_{r}^{s}\right)M^{\sigma}},\quad\hat{c}^{\sigma}=\frac{\hat{\rho}_{r}^{\sigma}}{\left(J-\varphi_{r}^{s}\right)M^{\sigma}}\,.\label{eq164}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Consider a general chemical reaction,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\alpha}\nu_{R}^{\alpha}\mathcal{E}^{\alpha}\to\sum\limits_{\alpha}\nu_{P}^{\alpha}\mathcal{E}^{\alpha}\,,\label{eq165}

;
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{R}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{P}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 represent stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products,
 respectively.
 Since the molar supply of reactants and products is constrained by stoichiometry,
 it follows that all molar supplies 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{c}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 in a specific chemical reaction may be related to a production rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\zeta}$
\end_inset

 according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{c}^{\alpha}=\nu^{\alpha}\hat{\zeta}\,,\label{eq166}

\begin_inset Formula $\nu^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nu^{\alpha}=\nu_{P}^{\alpha}-\nu_{R}^{\alpha}\,.\label{eq167}
\end{equation}

Thus,
 formulating constitutive relations for

\end_inset

 is equivalent to providing a single relation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\zeta}\left(\theta,\mathbf{F},c^{\alpha}\right)$
\end_inset

Boundary conditions may be derived by satisfying mass and momentum balance across a moving interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 The jump condition across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 derived from the axiom of mass balance requires that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\rho\mathbf{u}_{\Gamma}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0\,,\label{eq:mass-jump}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of the interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{\Gamma}$

 represents the velocity of the fluid relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 The double bracket notation denotes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[f\right]\right]=f_{+}-f_{-}$

\begin_inset Formula $V_{+}$

\begin_inset Formula $V_{-}$

 respectively.
 This jump condition implies that the mass flux normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 must be continuous.
 In particular,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{+}$
\end_inset

 is a fluid domain and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{-}$
\end_inset

 is a solid domain,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 a wall),
 we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{+}=\rho$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{+}=\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{-}=\mathbf{v}_{\Gamma}$

 for the solid,
 such that eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{\Gamma}\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

 The jump condition derived from the axiom of linear momentum balance similarly requires that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\boldsymbol{\sigma}-\rho\mathbf{u}_{\Gamma}\otimes\mathbf{u}_{\Gamma}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{0}\,.\label{eq:momentum-jump}

\end_inset

This condition implies that the jump in the traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 must be balanced by the jump in momentum flux normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to jump conditions dictated by axioms of conservation,
 viscous fluids require the satisfaction of the no-slip condition,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}\right)\cdot\left[\left[\mathbf{u}_{\Gamma}\right]\right]=\mathbf{0}\,,\label{eq:no-slip-condition}

 Thus,
 the mass jump in eq.

.
 In a mixture framework,
 all mixture constituents coexist at every point in the continuum.
 For our FSI implementation,
 the finite element mesh is defined on the solid material,
 and the negligible (but non-zero) elasticity of the solid is intended to regularize the mesh deformation.
 The fluid flows through this mesh,
 unimpeded by the solid.
 In particular,
 in this FSI model there is no frictional interaction between the fluid and solid materials inside the mixture domain (i.e.,
 no Darcy-Brinkman type of friction),
 but the no-slip boundary condition may be prescribed on boundaries of the mixture domain,
 where applicable.

The momentum balance for the fluid is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho^{f}\mathbf{a}^{f}=\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{f}+\rho^{f}\mathbf{b}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-momentum}
\end{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the external body force acting on the FSI domain,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid acceleration,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a}^{f}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}^{f}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{L}^{f}\cdot\mathbf{v}^{f}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-acceleration}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}^{f}=\grad\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid velocity gradient.
 In principle,
 the same momentum equation may be used for the solid (substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

);
 however,
 since we opted to let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{s}=0$
\end_inset

 (no solid mass),
 the momentum balance for the solid simply reduces to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{s}=\mathbf{0}\,.\label{eq:fsi-solid-momentum}

We model the fluid as isothermal and compressible,
 consistent with our CFD implementation.
 Thus,
 the fluid stress may be separated into the elastic pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(J^{f}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 which only depends on the fluid volume ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 and the viscous stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}\left(J^{f},\mathbf{L}^{f}\right)$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{f}=-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\tau}\,.\label{eq:fsi-fluid-stress-split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Recall that there is no dependence on temperature in an isothermal formulation.
 As done in our previous study,
 we integrate the mass balance for the fluid to produce
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho^{f}=\frac{\rho_{r}^{f}}{J^{f}}\,,\label{eq:fsi-integrated-fluid-mass}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid density in the reference state (e.g.,
 under ambient pressure) and 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}=\det\mathbf{F}^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid deformation gradient.
 We also use the kinematic constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial J^{f}}{\partial t}+\grad J^{f}\cdot\mathbf{v}^{f}=J^{f}\divg\mathbf{v}^{f}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-kinematic constraint}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to relate the fluid volume ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 to its velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 in the spatial frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mesh through which the fluid flows is defined on the solid component of the mixture.
 Therefore,
 we define the relative velocity between the fluid and solid as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{v}^{f}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\,.\label{eq:fsi-fluid-relative-velocity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the solid has zero volume fraction,
 this expression is the same as the flux of fluid relative to the solid.
 We choose to define the nodal degrees of freedom in the mixture domain to be the relative fluid velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

,
 the fluid dilatation 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{f}=J^{f}-1$
\end_inset

,
 and the solid displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{s}$
\end_inset

,
 which is related to the solid velocity via 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{s}=\dot{\mathbf{u}}^{s}$
\end_inset

,
 with the dot operator denoting the material time derivative following the solid.
 (For notational convenience,
 we will continue using 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 in the equations below,
 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{f}$
\end_inset

).
 Now,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}^{f}=\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{v}^{s}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-velocity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

from which it follows that the fluid velocity gradient is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L}^{f}=\mathbf{L}^{w}+\mathbf{L}^{s}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-velocity-gradient}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}^{w}=\grad\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}^{s}=\grad\mathbf{v}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The fluid acceleration may now be rewritten in terms of the FEA degrees of freedom as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a}^{f}=\dot{\mathbf{w}}+\dot{\mathbf{v}}^{s}+\left(\mathbf{L}^{w}+\mathbf{L}^{s}\right)\cdot\mathbf{w}\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-acceleration-redux}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\dot{\mathbf{v}}^{s} & =\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}^{s}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{L}^{s}\cdot\mathbf{v}^{s}\\
\dot{\mathbf{w}} & =\frac{\partial\mathbf{w}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{L}^{w}\cdot\mathbf{v}^{s}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:fsi-vs-w-material-derivs}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

are the material time derivatives of the solid and relative fluid velocities,
 in the frame following the solid.
 We conveniently use this material time derivative (instead of the material time derivative following the fluid) since we define the mixture domain mesh on the solid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly,
 the kinematic constraint relating 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 may be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{J}^{f}+\grad J^{f}\cdot\mathbf{w}=J^{f}\divg\left(\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)\,,\label{eq:fsi-fluid-kinematic-redux}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{J}^{f}=\frac{\partial J^{f}}{\partial t}+\grad J^{f}\cdot\mathbf{v}^{s}\,.\label{eq:fsi-dilatation-material-deriv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Finally,
 as done routinely in our studies of biphasic and multiphasic materials,
 we find it convenient to substitute the kinematic identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\divg\mathbf{v}^{s}=\frac{\dot{J}^{s}}{J^{s}}\,,\label{eq:fsi-solid-kinematic-constraint}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{s}=\det\mathbf{F}^{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}=\mathbf{I}+\Grad\mathbf{u}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the solid deformation gradient.

In summary,
 the governing equations for the FSI mixture domain are
\begin_inset Formula

 A hybrid biphasic domain is a mixture of an isothermal compressible viscous fluid and a hyperelastic compressible porous solid whose solid skeleton is intrinsically incompressible.
 Unlike the fluid-FSI material,
 here the solid has non-negligible mass density and elasticity,
 and frictional interactions may occur between the fluid and solid constituents,
 modeled using a hydraulic permeability (Section

 In FEBio,
 the hybrid biphasic material is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

biphasic-FSI
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 since it allows dynamic fluid-structure interactions between this material and a fluid-FSI material,

 Here,
 we may abbreviate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 as BFSI.
 For BFSI domains,
 as with standard biphasic domains,
 the finite element mesh is defined on the porous solid material.
 The viscous fluid flows through this mesh,
 experiencing frictional drag caused by the porous solid.
 When two BFSI domains are interfaced,
 or when a BFSI domain is interfaced with a fluid-FSI domain,
 the pseudo-no slip condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 When a BFSI domain interfaces with a solid domain,

\begin_layout Standard
We model the BFSI domain as an unconstrained mixture of an isothermal,
 compressible,
 and viscous fluid and an isothermal,
 deformable porous solid whose skeleton material is intrinsically incompressible.
 As usual in mixture theory,
 each constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=s,f$
\end_inset

 for solid and fluid,
 respectively) has its own apparent density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}=dm^{\alpha}/dV$
\end_inset

,
 which represents the ratio of the elemental mass 
\begin_inset Formula $dm^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 of constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in the elemental mixture volume 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

.
 This apparent density is related to the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{\alpha}=dm^{\alpha}/dV^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 (mass of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 per volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) via 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\alpha}=\varphi^{\alpha}\rho_{T}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{\alpha}=dV^{\alpha}/dV$
\end_inset

 is the volume fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in the mixture,
 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{s}+\varphi^{f}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since the solid skeleton is intrinsically incompressible,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is constant.
 The boundaries of a biphasic domain are defined on the porous solid matrix.
 The deformation gradient of the solid is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}$
\end_inset

 and its determinant,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{s}=\det\mathbf{F}^{s}=dV/dV_{r}$
\end_inset

,
 represents the ratio of the mixture elemental volumes in the current (
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

) and reference (
\begin_inset Formula $dV_{r}$
\end_inset

) configurations.
 Thus,
 since the solid skeleton is intrinsically incompressible,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{s}$
\end_inset

 purely represents the compressibility of the pore volume as fluid enters or leaves the pore space,
 or as the compressible fluid within the pores changes in volume.
 The axiom of mass balance for the solid may be integrated in closed form to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{s}=\rho_{r}^{s}/J^{s}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{s}=dm^{s}/dV_{r}$
\end_inset

 is the solid apparent density in the mixture reference configuration.
 Therefore,
 we may define the referential solid volume fraction as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{s}=\rho_{r}^{s}/\rho_{T}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 In the finite element analysis,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{s}=dV^{s}/dV_{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{s}$
\end_inset

 are both specified by the user,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{f}$
\end_inset

 are evaluated from the above relations,
 given a solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}$
\end_inset

 (and thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{s}$
\end_inset

).
 The solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}=\mathbf{I}+\Grad\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by solving for the nodal solid displacement vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Grad\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 represents the gradient operator in the material frame.

\begin_layout Standard
For the compressible fluid phase of a hybrid biphasic material,
 the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{T}^{f}$
\end_inset

 varies with the intrinsic fluid volumetric strain,
 or dilatation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{f}=J^{f}-1$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the volume ratio of the fluid in its current and reference configurations,
 
\begin_inset Formula $dm^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the element mass of fluid and 
\begin_inset Formula $dV^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the elemental volume of that fluid in the pores of the mixture,
 in the current configuration.
 It follows from this definition that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J^{f}=\frac{dV^{f}}{dV_{r}^{f}}=\frac{dV^{f}}{dm^{f}}\frac{dm^{f}}{dV_{r}^{f}}=\frac{\rho_{Tr}^{f}}{\rho_{T}^{f}}\thinspace,\label{eq:bfsi-Jf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dV_{r}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the elemental volume of this same fluid (having the same elemental mass 
\begin_inset Formula $dm^{f}$
\end_inset

) in the fluid's reference configuration.
 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{Tr}^{f}=dm^{f}/dV_{r}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is a constant representing the true fluid density in its reference configuration,
 which is specified by the user.
 Accordingly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}=1$
\end_inset

 in the limit when the fluid is idealized to be intrinsically incompressible.
 This definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 is consistent with that for a pure fluid,
 as shown in our earlier formulation of computational fluid dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 As shown above,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{f}$
\end_inset

 may be evaluated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{f}\rho_{T}^{f}$
\end_inset

 which now expands into an expression involving solid and fluid volume ratios,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho^{f}=\left(1-\frac{\varphi_{r}^{s}}{J^{s}}\right)\frac{\rho_{Tr}^{f}}{J^{f}}\,.\label{eq:bfsi-rhof-Jf-Js}

\end_inset

The limiting case when the fluid within the solid matrix pores has been completely squeezed out corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{f}=0$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $dm^{f}=0$
\end_inset

).
 Based on the above relation,
 this is equivalent to having the entire mixture volume 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

 reduce to the solid volume 
\begin_inset Formula $dV^{s}$
\end_inset

 in the current configuration,
 or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{s}=\varphi_{r}^{s}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In this limiting case,
 the mixture becomes an intrinsically incompressible solid and the finite element formulation presented in this study no longer applies.

 The fluid dilatation 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{f}$

\begin_layout Standard
Since the axiom of mass balance for the solid has already been solved in closed form,
 we only need to be concerned with the axiom of mass balance for the fluid,
 or alternatively,
 that of the mixture,
 which takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{D^{f}J^{f}}{Dt}=\frac{J^{f}}{\varphi^{f}}\divg\left(\mathbf{v}^{s}+\mathbf{w}\right)\thinspace,\label{eq:bfsi-mix-mass-balance-f}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the solid velocity (the material time derivative of the solid displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

),
 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{w}=\varphi^{f}\left(\mathbf{v}^{f}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)\thinspace\label{eq:bfsi-fluid-flux}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is the volumetric flux of the fluid relative to the solid ,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 representing the fluid velocity.
 Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{f}\left(\cdot\right)/Dt$
\end_inset

 is the material time derivative operator in the spatial frame,
 following the fluid motion.
 Since the finite element mesh is defined on the porous solid matrix of a biphasic mixture,
 and since the fluid flows relative to the solid,
 material time derivatives need to follow the solid motion in the finite element implementation.
 A similar scheme was used in our implementations of solute transport within deformable porous domains (Sections

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this expression,
 the dot operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{J}^{f}$
\end_inset

 represents the material time derivative following the solid motion.
 In the solid material frame,
 this material time derivative reduces to the partial time derivative.
 Accordingly,
 we may now write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{s}=\dot{\mathbf{u}}$

 In the BFSI implementation,
 the fluid volumetric flux 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$

 relative to the solid is added to the list of nodal DOFs,
 giving us the complete set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{w},e^{f}\right)$

Since the finite element implementation requires all material time derivatives to follow the motion of the solid,
 we recognize that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{s}=\ddot{\mathbf{u}}$
\end_inset

 and we evaluate the fluid acceleration as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{f}=\dot{\mathbf{v}}^{f}+\grad\mathbf{v}^{f}\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}^{f}-\mathbf{v}^{s}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is not a nodal degree of freedom,
 we use eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}^{f}=\frac{1}{\varphi^{f}}\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{v}^{s}\label{eq:bfsi-fluid-velocity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

into this expression.
 It follows that the fluid velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{L}^{f}=\grad\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 may be evaluated as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L}^{f}=\mathbf{L}^{s}+\frac{1}{\varphi^{f}}\left(\mathbf{L}^{w}-\frac{1}{\varphi^{f}}\mathbf{w}\otimes\grad\varphi^{f}\right)\,,\label{eq:bfsi-Lf}

 Now,
 the fluid acceleration takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a}^{f}=\frac{1}{\varphi^{f}}\left(\dot{\mathbf{w}}+\phi^{f}\ddot{\mathbf{u}}-\frac{\varphi^{s}}{\varphi^{f}}\frac{\dot{J}^{s}}{J^{s}}\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{L}^{f}\cdot\mathbf{w}\right)\,.\label{eq:bfsi-af}

Jump conditions on the axioms of mass,
 momentum and energy balance are needed to determine which variables may be selected as nodal DOFs in the finite element implementation,
 and which tractions are naturally continuous across an interface.
 The full set of jump conditions for a hybrid biphasic material were derived in our recent study for the constitutive assumptions adopted in this formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Here,
 we summarize the salient results,
 which apply to an interface defined on the porous solid matrix of the hybrid biphasic domain,
 which includes the shared faces of adjoining biphasic elements.
 Thus,
 the velocity of the interface is given by the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{s}$
\end_inset

 of the solid constituent of the hybrid biphasic material.
 We employ the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[f\right]\right]=f_{+}-f_{-}$
\end_inset

 to denote the jump in the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 across the interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{-}$

 denoting the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 which points away from the 
\begin_inset Formula $+$

 A variable 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 which is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[f\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the jump condition on the axiom of mass balance,
 the normal component of the mass flux of the fluid relative to the solid is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\rho_{T}^{f}\mathbf{w}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 a sufficient condition to satisfy the jump on the axiom of energy balance is to enforce continuity of the fluid specific free enthalpy (also known as the Gibbs function),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\psi^{f}+p/\rho_{T}^{f}\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid specific free energy.
 This jump condition applies only when there is fluid on both sides of the interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

.
 In an isothermal framework the specific free enthalpy is a function of state that only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 therefore this energy jump condition implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 must be continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[J^{f}\right]\right]=0\,,\label{eq:bfsi-Jf-jump}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

also implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[p\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 Given eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\rho_{T}^{f}\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 and the mass balance jump condition reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{w}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

,
 implying that the relative fluid flux component normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 must be continuous.
 For the tangential component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 we appeal to the analysis of Hou et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hou1989"

\end_inset

,
 who showed that a valid pseudo-noslip condition requires this tangential component to be continuous.
 Combining these two jump conditions produces
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\mathbf{w}\right]\right]=0\,.\label{eq:bfsi-fluid-flux-jump}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The momentum jump condition requires that the mixture traction be continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}+\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[p\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 based on the energy jump,
 this mixture momentum jump condition reduces to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}+\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0\,.\label{eq:bfsi-mix-mtm-jump}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Finally,
 another relation which is sufficient to satisfy the jump condition on the energy balance is the continuity of the true fluid traction (force acting on fluid per fluid area),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\frac{\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}}{\varphi^{f}}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0\,.\label{eq:bfsi-fluid-mtm-jump}

 which also applies only if fluid is present on both sides of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is interesting because it implies that the viscous stress (and thus,
 the viscosity) of a fluid flowing in a porous solid matrix scales with the porosity of that medium,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}=\phi^{f}\boldsymbol{\tau}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}$
\end_inset

 would be the true fluid viscous stress.
 Thus,
 we can use FEBio's various constitutive relations for the viscous stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}$
\end_inset

 of Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids and adapt those models to a biphasic mixture where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{f}\boldsymbol{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 Accordingly,
 the contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}^{f}$
\end_inset

 would properly reduce to zero in the limit as fluid content reduces to zero (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{f}\to0$
\end_inset

Jump conditions on the axioms of mass,

 Here,

 Here,
 since the domain is fixed in space,

 A variable 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the jump condition on the axiom of mass balance for the fluid,
 the normal component of the mass flux of the fluid is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\rho^{f}\mathbf{v}^{f}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 a sufficient condition to satisfy the jump on the axiom of energy balance is to enforce continuity of the solvent specific free enthalpy (or Gibbs function),
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\psi^{f}+p/\rho_{T}^{f}\right]\right]=\left[\left[\mu^{f}\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid specific free energy.
 In the multiphasic mixture literature,
 the solvent specific free enthalpy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{f}$
\end_inset

 is also called the mechano-chemical potential 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ateshian16"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This jump condition applies only when there is solvent on both sides of the interface,
 such as across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

.
 In an isothermal framework,
 the solvent mechano-chemical potential is a function of state that only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{f}=\mu^{f}\left(J^{f}\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

.
 Therefore this energy jump condition implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{f}$
\end_inset

 must be continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[J^{f}\right]\right]=0\,,\label{eq:J-Jump-CFDSol}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

also implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\tilde{p}\right]\right]=0$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Fluid-Dil-CFDSol"

 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\rho^{f}\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 and the fluid mass balance jump condition reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{v}^{f}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

,
 implying that the fluid velocity component normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

 must be continuous.
 For the tangential component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{f}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

 we use the no-slip condition for viscous fluids,
 which states that the velocity component tangential to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

 must be continuous across that interface,
 as is standard in CFD solvers.
 Combining these two jump conditions produces
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\mathbf{v}^{f}\right]\right]=0\,.\label{eq:Mass-Jump-Final-CFDSol}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
From the solute mass jump condition,
 we can show that the normal component of the molar solute flux is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\mathbf{j}^{\iota}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0\,.\label{eq:Mass-Jump-Sol-CFDSol}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The momentum jump condition requires that the mixture traction be continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{f}$
\end_inset

,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\tau}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Another relation which is thermodynamically sufficient to satisfy the jump condition on the energy balance is the continuity of the viscous fluid traction,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\boldsymbol{\tau}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0\,.\label{eq:Fluid-Mtm-Jump-CFDSol}

 which also applies only if fluid is present on both sides of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[p\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the last relation that is thermodynamically sufficient to satisfy the energy balance jump condition applies to the electrochemical potential for the solutes,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\tilde{\mu}^{\iota}\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 For a solute,
 the general constitutive relation for the electrochemical potential is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}^{\iota}=\frac{R\theta}{M^{\iota}}\ln\frac{c^{\iota}}{\tilde{\kappa}^{\alpha}c_{0}^{\iota}}$
\end_inset

 and the jump can be simplified to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\tilde{c}^{\iota}\right]\right]=0\,.\label{eq:Conc-Jump-CFDSol}

\begin_layout Standard
Generally,
 the finite element formulation is established in terms of a weak form of the differential equations under consideration.
 In the context of solid mechanics this implies the use of the virtual work equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W=\int\limits_{v}\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\delta\mathbf{d}\,dv-\int\limits_{v}\mathbf{f}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,dv-\int\limits_{\partial v}\mathbf{t}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,da=0\,.\label{eq171}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a virtual velocity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 is the virtual rate of deformation tensor.
 This equation is known as the 
\emph on
spatial virtual work equation 
\emph default
since it is formulated using spatial quantities only.
 We can also define the 
\emph on
material virtual work equation 
\emph default
by expressing the principle of virtual work using only material quantities.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W=\int\limits_{V}\mathbf{S}:\delta\mathbf{\dot{E}}\,dV-\int\limits_{V}\mathbf{f}_{0}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,dV-\int\limits_{\partial V}\mathbf{t}_{0}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,dA=0\,.\label{eq172}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{0}=J\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

 is the body force per unit undeformed volume and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}=\mathbf{t}\left(da/dA\right)$

 is the traction vector per unit initial area.

 is the starting point for the nonlinear finite element method.
 It is highly nonlinear and any method attempting to solve this equation,
 such as the Newton-Raphson method,
 necessarily has to be iterative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To linearize the finite element equations,
 the directional derivative of the virtual work in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 must be calculated.
 In an iterative procedure,
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\phi}$
\end_inset

 will be approximated by a trial solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Linearization of the virtual work equation around this trial solution gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W\left(\boldsymbol{\phi}_{k},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)+D\delta W\left(\boldsymbol{\phi}_{k},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)\left[\mathbf{u}\right]=0\,.\label{eq173}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The directional derivative of the virtual work will eventually lead to the definition of the stiffness matrix.
 In order to proceed,
 it is convenient to split the virtual work into an internal and external virtual work component:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\delta W\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)\left[\mathbf{u}\right]=D\delta W_{int}\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)\left[\mathbf{u}\right]-D\delta W_{ext}\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)\left[\mathbf{u}\right],\label{eq174}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{int}\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)=\int\limits_{v}\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\delta\mathbf{d}\,dv\,,\label{eq175}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{ext}\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)=\int\limits_{v}\mathbf{f}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,dv+\int\limits_{\partial v}\mathbf{t}\cdot\delta\mathbf{v}\,da\,.\label{eq176}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The result is listed here without details of the derivation – see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 for details.
 The linearization of the internal virtual work is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\delta W_{int}\left(\boldsymbol{\phi},\delta\mathbf{v}\right)\left[\mathbf{u}\right]=\int\limits_{v}\delta\mathbf{d}:\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,dv+\int\limits_{v}\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\left[\left(\nabla\mathbf{u}\right)^{T}\cdot\nabla\delta\mathbf{v}\right]\,dv\,.\label{eq177}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Notice that this equation is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 This symmetry will,
 upon discretization,
 yield a symmetric tangent matrix.

FEBio currently supports gravity as a body force,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}=\rho\mathbf{g}$

 Since this force is independent of the geometry,
 the contribution to the linearized external work is zero.
 Another type of body force implemented in FEBio is the centrifugal force.
 For a body rotating with a constant angular speed 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 about an axis passing through the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

 the body force is given by

The basis of the finite element method is that the domain of the problem (that is,

 called 
\emph on

 In the case of

isoparametric elements 
\emph default
it is further assumed that each element has a local coordinate system,
 named the

 and the coordinates and shape of the element are discretized using the same functions.
 The discretization process is established by interpolating the geometry in terms of the coordinates

where

In deriving the discretized equilibrium equations,

 The discretized equilibrium equations for this particular element per node is given by

Similarly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{K}}$

 is a fourth-order tensor that represents the spatial measure of the rate of change of permeability with strain.
 It is related to its material frame equivalent 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{K}}$
\end_inset

 via 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\mathcal{K}}=J^{-1}\left(\mathbf{F}\,\underline{\otimes}\,\mathbf{F}\right):\boldsymbol{\mathbb{K}}:\left(\mathbf{F}^{T}\,\underline{\otimes}\,\mathbf{F}^{T}\right),\label{eq202}

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{K}}=\partial\mathbf{K}/\partial\mathbf{E}$

 is the permeability tensor in the material frame,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}=J^{-1}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{K}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{T}$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{K}$

 it follows that

 exhibit two minor symmetries (e.g.,

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{ijlk}=\mathcal{K}_{ijkl})$
\end_inset

 However,
 unlike the elasticity tensor,
 it is not necessary that these tensors exhibit major symmetry (e.g.,

\begin_layout Standard
Finite element models of deformable porous media are known to exhibit oscillations in fluid pressure caused by relatively coarse meshes near free-draining boundaries,
 where a boundary layer in fluid pressure normally forms during the early time response to loading.
 These spurious oscillations typically occur when the mesh is not able to resolve this boundary layer.
 Stabilization methods serve as an alternative to mesh refinement,
 when the latter is not feasible or practical.
 In FEBio we have implemented a stabilization method based on the work of Aguilar et al.

 depends on whether natural boundary conditions are prescribed as area densities or total net values over an area.
 Thus,
 in the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}\,da$
\end_inset

 (net force),
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}da$
\end_inset

 (net volumetric flow rate),
 or

\begin_inset Formula $da$

 there is no variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{\text{ext}}$
\end_inset

 and it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $D\delta W_{\text{ext}}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively,
 in the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{n}$
\end_inset

 are prescribed,
 the linearization may be performed by evaluating the integral in the parametric space of the boundary surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial b$
\end_inset

,
 with parametric coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\eta^{1},\eta^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Accordingly,
 for a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\left(\eta^{1},\eta^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial b$
\end_inset

,
 surface tangents (covariant basis vectors) are given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial\eta^{\alpha}},\quad\left(\alpha=1,2\right)\label{eq260}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the outward unit normal is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{n}=\frac{\mathbf{g}_{1}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}}{\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}\right|}\,.\label{eq261}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The elemental area on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial b$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $da=\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}\right|d\eta^{1}d\eta^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently,
 the external virtual work integral may be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{\text{ext}}=\int_{\partial b}\left(\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{t}+\delta\tilde{p}\,w_{n}+\delta\tilde{c}\,j_{n}\right)\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}\right|d\eta^{1}d\eta^{2}\,.\label{eq262}

\end_inset

The directional derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{\text{ext}}$
\end_inset

 may then be applied directly to its integrand,

\begin{aligned}\delta W & =\int_{\Omega}\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\left(\divg\boldsymbol{\sigma}+\rho\left(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{a}\right)\right)dv\\
 & +\int_{\Omega}\delta J\left(\frac{\dot{J}}{J}-\divg\mathbf{v}\right)dv\,,
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:virtual work}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a virtual velocity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta J$
\end_inset

 is a virtual energy density;
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the fluid finite element domain and 
\begin_inset Formula $dv$
\end_inset

 is a differential volume in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 This virtual work statement may be directly related to the axiom of energy balance,
 specialized to conditions of isothermal flow of viscous compressible fluids (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:CFD-Energy-Balance"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Using the divergence theorem,
 we may rewrite the weak form of this integral as the difference between external and internal virtual work,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W=\delta W_{ext}-\delta W_{int}$
\end_inset

,
 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta W_{int} & =\int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol{\tau}:\grad\delta\mathbf{v}\,dv+\int_{\Omega}\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\left(\grad p+\rho\mathbf{a}\right)\,dv\\
 & -\int_{\Omega}\left(\delta J\frac{\dot{J}}{J}+\grad\delta J\cdot\mathbf{v}\right)\,dv\,,
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:virtual-work-internal-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{ext}=\int_{\partial\Omega}\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{t}^{\tau}\,da+\int_{\Omega}\delta\mathbf{v}\cdot\rho\mathbf{b}\,dv-\int_{\partial\Omega}\delta J\,v_{n}\,da\,.\label{eq:virtual-work-external-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $da$
\end_inset

 is a differential area on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\Omega$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\tau}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is the viscous component of the traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity normal to the boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\Omega$
\end_inset

,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 representing the outward normal on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 From these expressions,
 it becomes evident that essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions may be prescribed on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

,
 while natural (Neumann) boundary conditions may be prescribed on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The appearance of velocity in both essential and natural boundary conditions may seem surprising at first.
 To better understand the nature of these boundary conditions,
 it is convenient to separate the velocity into its normal and tangential components,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=v_{n}\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}=\left(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}\right)\cdot\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 In particular,
 for inviscid flow,
 the viscous stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and its corresponding traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 are both zero,
 leaving 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 as the sole natural boundary condition;
 similarly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 becomes the only essential boundary condition in such flows,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is unknown 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 on a frictionless boundary and must be obtained from the solution of the analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general,
 prescribing 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to prescribing the elastic fluid pressure,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is only a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

.
 On a boundary where no conditions are prescribed explicitly,
 we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

,
 which represents a frictionless wall.
 Conversely,
 it is possible to prescribe 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 on a boundary to produce a desired inflow or outflow while simultaneously stabilizing the flow conditions by prescribing a suitable viscous traction.
 Prescribing essential boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 determines the tangential velocity on a boundary as well as the elastic fluid pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

,
 leaving the option to also prescribe the normal component of the viscous traction,
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}^{\tau}=\mathbf{t}^{\tau}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

,
 to completely determine the normal traction 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}=\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 (or else 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 naturally equals zero).
 Mixed boundary conditions represent common physical features:
 Prescribing 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 completely determines the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 on a boundary;
 prescribing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 completely determines the traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 on a boundary.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 are mutually exclusive boundary conditions,
 and the same holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the tangential component of the viscous traction,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{t}^{\tau}=\left(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}\right)\cdot\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$

 letting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=\mathbf{0}$

 Instead,
 these authors proposed a velocity-dependent traction boundary condition,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=\beta\rho\left(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v}\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 with a tensile normal component,
 that counters the backflow (only when

 We adapt this previously proposed formulation by letting the normal component of the viscous traction be given by

\begin_layout Standard
In the generalized 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-$
\end_inset

method we evaluate displacements and velocities at the intermediate time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+\alpha_{f}}=t_{n}+\alpha_{f}\left(t_{n+1}-t_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\boldsymbol{\chi}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s} & =\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\boldsymbol{\chi}_{n}^{s}+\alpha_{f}\boldsymbol{\chi}_{n+1}^{s}\\
\mathbf{u}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s} & =\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\mathbf{u}_{n}^{s}+\alpha_{f}\mathbf{u}_{n+1}^{s}\\
\mathbf{v}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s} & =\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\mathbf{v}_{n}^{s}+\alpha_{f}\mathbf{v}_{n+1}^{s}\\
\mathbf{w}_{n+\alpha_{f}} & =\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\mathbf{w}_{n}+\alpha_{f}\mathbf{w}_{n+1}\\
J_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{f} & =\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)J_{n}^{f}+\alpha_{f}J_{n+1}^{f}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

In particular,
 it follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\chi}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}}{\partial\mathbf{X}}=\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\mathbf{F}_{n}^{s}+\alpha_{f}\mathbf{F}_{n+1}^{s}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=\det\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{J}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=J_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{-T}:\Grad\mathbf{v}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{L}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=\Grad\mathbf{v}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}\cdot\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

In practice however,
 we get better numerical results when using
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{J}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=\frac{J_{n+1}^{s}-J_{n}^{s}}{\Delta t}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{L}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}=\frac{\mathbf{F}_{n+1}-\mathbf{F}_{n}}{\Delta t}\cdot\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

Similarly,
 we evaluate velocity derivatives at the intermediate time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+\alpha_{m}}=t_{n}+\alpha_{m}\left(t_{n+1}-t_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}^{s} & =\left(1-\alpha_{m}\right)\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n}^{s}+\alpha_{m}\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n+1}^{s}\\
\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n+\alpha_{m}} & =\left(1-\alpha_{m}\right)\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n}+\alpha_{m}\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n+1}\\
\dot{J}_{n+\alpha_{m}}^{f} & =\left(1-\alpha_{m}\right)\dot{J}_{n}^{f}+\alpha_{m}\dot{J}_{n+1}^{f}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{m}$
\end_inset

 are evaluated from a single parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 using
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{f}=\frac{1}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\quad\alpha_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{3-\rho_{\infty}}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\label{eq:fsi-ga-alphas-1st}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for first-order systems,
 or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{f}=\frac{1}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\quad\alpha_{m}=\frac{2-\rho_{\infty}}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\label{eq:fsi-ga-alphas-2nd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for second-order systems,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\rho_{\infty}\le1$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter is the spectral radius for an infinite time step,
 which controls the amount of damping of high frequencies;
 a value of zero produces the greatest amount of damping,
 anihilating the highest frequency in one step,
 whereas a value of one preserves the highest frequency.
 Since the solid motion is governed by a second-order differential equation in time,
 we adopt the formulas for second-order systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To complete the integration scheme,
 we evaluate
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\beta & =\frac{1}{4}\left(1+\alpha_{m}-\alpha_{f}\right)^{2}\\
\gamma & =\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_{m}-\alpha_{f}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{v}_{n+1}^{s} & =\mathbf{v}_{n}^{s}+\Delta t\left[\left(1-\gamma\right)\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n}^{s}+\gamma\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n+1}^{s}\right]\\
\mathbf{u}_{n+1}^{s} & =\mathbf{u}_{n}^{s}+\Delta t\mathbf{v}_{n}^{s}+\frac{\Delta t^{2}}{2}\left[\left(1-2\beta\right)\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n}^{s}+2\beta\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n+1}^{s}\right]\\
\mathbf{w}_{n+1} & =\mathbf{w}_{n}+\Delta t\left[\left(1-\gamma\right)\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n}+\gamma\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n+1}\right]\\
J_{n+1}^{f} & =J_{n}^{f}+\Delta t\left[\left(1-\gamma\right)\dot{J}_{n}^{f}+\gamma\dot{J}_{n+1}^{f}\right]
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n+1}^{s} & =\frac{1}{\beta\Delta t}\left(\frac{\mathbf{u}_{n+1}^{s}-\mathbf{u}_{n}^{s}}{\Delta t}-\mathbf{v}_{n}^{s}\right)+\left(1-\frac{1}{2\beta}\right)\dot{\mathbf{v}}_{n}^{s}\\
\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n+1} & =\frac{\mathbf{w}_{n+1}-\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\gamma\Delta t}+\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n}=\frac{\mathbf{w}_{n+\alpha_{f}}-\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\alpha_{f}\gamma\Delta t}-\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}-1\right)\dot{\mathbf{w}}_{n}\\
\dot{J}_{n+1}^{f} & =\frac{J_{n+1}^{f}-J_{n}^{f}}{\gamma\Delta t}+\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\dot{J}_{n}^{f}=\frac{J_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{f}-J_{n}^{f}}{\alpha_{f}\gamma\Delta t}-\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}-1\right)\dot{J}_{n}^{f}

\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{int}$
\end_inset

 over the material frame of the finite element solid domain.
 For notational convenience,
 we let 
\begin_inset Formula $J\equiv J^{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}\equiv\mathbf{F}^{s}$

 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula

 Similarly,

 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

In general,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{s}$

 following the standard approach in solid mechanics,
 the linearization of

 However,
 since

 The integrands of the surface integrals represent the natural boundary conditions for this formulation.

 However,
 there are two general scenarios where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 needs to be prescribed on a region of the boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\Omega^{b}$
\end_inset

 with incomplete prior knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

,
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

:
 (1) When a BFSI boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{b}$
\end_inset

 represents a free surface (such as the fluid surface in channel flow),
 the mixture traction boundary condition requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

,
 in which case it is necessary to explicitly enforce 
\begin_inset Formula $-p\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{t}^{\sigma}+\mathbf{t}^{\tau}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 as a constraint equation on that boundary,
 to impart the free surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{b}$
\end_inset

 its natural shape.
 (2) At a biphasic-solid interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{bs}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 must balance the traction acting on the adjoining solid domain.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{bs}$
\end_inset

 due to shared nodes,
 the solid natural boundary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 is already accounted for by the deformation,
 so that it is only necessary to prescribe the portion 
\begin_inset Formula $-p\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 on the solid domain,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $-p\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{t}^{\tau}+\mathbf{t}^{s}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the (equal and opposite) traction acting on the solid domain.
 In both cases,
 the form of this traction boundary condition is the same,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{s}$
\end_inset

 representing the tractions acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{b}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{bs}$

 respectively.

For both of these cases,
 the resulting virtual work on the free surface

As a result,
 the virtual work can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta F=-\int_{\Gamma}\delta\mathbf{v}^{s}\cdot\left(-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\tau}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbf{g}_{1}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}\right)\,d\eta^{1}d\eta^{2}\,.\label{eq:bfsi-traction-final}

In FEBio this boundary condition is called 
\emph on
BFSI traction
\emph default
,
 which the user must explicitly prescribe on free surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{b}$
\end_inset

 and deformable interfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{bs}$

 The code automatically determines which of these two types of interfaces is being considered.

The formation of the stiffness matrix and,

 calculation of its inverse,
 are computationally expensive.
 Quasi-Newton methods do not require the reevaluation of the stiffness matrix for every iteration.
 Instead,
 a quick update is calculated.
 One particular method that has been quite successful in the field of computational solid mechanics is the BFGS method,
 which is described in the next section.

 A displacement increment is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{d}_{k}=\mathbf{x}_{k}-\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\,,\label{eq357}

and an increment in the residual is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G}_{k}=\mathbf{R}_{k-1}-\mathbf{R}_{k}\,.\label{eq358}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The updated matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{K}_{k}$
\end_inset

 should satisfy the quasi-Newton equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K}_{k}\mathbf{d}_{k}=\mathbf{G}_{k}\,.\label{eq359}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In order to calculate this update,
 as displacement increment is first calculated:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{K}_{k-1}^{-1}\mathbf{R}_{k-1}\,.\label{eq360}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This displacement vector defines a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

direction
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for the actual displacement increment.
 A line search (see next section) can now be applied to determine the optimal displacement increment:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{k}=\mathbf{x}_{k-1}+s\mathbf{u}\,,\label{eq361}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

is determined from the line search.
 With the updated position calculated,

can be evaluated.

 it should be noted that using the matrix updates defined above,
 the calculation of the search direction in

 can be rewritten as,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 the search direction can be computed without explicitly calculating the updated matrices or performing any additional costly matrix factorizations as required in the full Newton-Raphson method.

.
 In this method,
 the direction of the displacement vector 
\series bold

is considered as optimal,
 but the magnitude is controlled by a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=\mathbf{x}_{k}+s\mathbf{u}\,.\label{eq367}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

is usually chosen so that the total potential energy 
\begin_inset Formula $W\left(s\right)=W\left(\mathbf{x}_{k}+s\mathbf{u}\right)$
\end_inset

at the end of the iteration is minimized in the direction of 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset


\series default
.
 This is equivalent to the requirement that the residual force 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}\left(\mathbf{x}_{k}+s\mathbf{u}\right)$
\end_inset

at the end of the iteration is orthogonal to 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(s\right)=\mathbf{u}^{T}\mathbf{R}\left(\mathbf{x}_{k}+s\mathbf{u}\right)=0\,.\label{eq368}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

However,
 in practice it is sufficient to obtain a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

such that,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|R\left(s\right)\right|<\rho\left|R\left(0\right)\right|\,,\label{eq369}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where typically a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.9$
\end_inset

 is used.
 Under normal conditions the value 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 automatically satisfies equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq369"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and therefore few extra operations are involved.
 However,
 when this is not the case,
 a more suitable value for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

needs to be obtained.
 For this reason it is convenient to approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

as a quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(s\right)\approx\left(1-s\right)R\left(0\right)+R\left(1\right)s^{2}=0\,,\label{eq370}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which yields a value for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s=\frac{r}{2}\pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)^{2}-r}\,,\quad r=\frac{R\left(0\right)}{R\left(1\right)}\,.\label{eq371}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $r<0$
\end_inset

,
 the square root is positive and a first improved value for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

is obtained:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s_{1}=\frac{r}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)^{2}-r}\,.\label{eq372}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $r>0$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

can be obtained by using the value that minimizes the quadratic function,
 that is,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}=r/2$
\end_inset

.
 This procedure is now repeated with 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s_{1}\right)$

 until equation

\begin_layout Subsection
Conjugate gradient solution method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Newton-Raphson solution algorithms are highly effective for nearly linear problems,
 but they have two major limitations.
 Firstly,
 for very large models,
 the size of the stiffness matrix K can grow very large as well.
 The factorization of this matrix,
 which is needed when using direct linear solvers,
 can become very time consuming and requires a large amount of memory.
 This is the main factor that limits the size of model that can be solved on a given computer.
 Secondly,
 where the stiffness is small,
 it can overestimate the displacement,
 resulting in excessive distortion of the mesh and the familiar negative Jacobian failure.
 This can occur when a material has a low initial stiffness that increases at higher strains (we work around this by using a large number of small timesteps to reduce the nonlinearity on each increment),
 when buckling causes a temporary low or negative stiffness,
 when a part of the model is not sufficiently constrained,
 or when contacts cause sudden changes of stiffness.
 For these reasons the Newton-Raphson algorithms often fail to converge for very nonlinear materials,
 models with contacts or unstable structures that can buckle or crumple under load.

An alternative strategy is to estimate a direction to move each node directly from the residual R:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{u=-}\boldsymbol{R\left(x_{k}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then a line search is needed to find the appropriate distance to move in that direction.
 This is the steepest descent method,
 which has the disadvantage that it converges slowly in a series of decreasing zig-zag steps.
 Its convergence is much improved by adding a fraction β of the previous step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{u}_{k}=-\boldsymbol{R}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{k}\right)+\beta\boldsymbol{u}_{k-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many different ways to calculate β;
 one method which has excellent convergence for nonlinear problems is due to Hager and Zhang:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=\boldsymbol{R}_{i-1}-\boldsymbol{R}_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}=\frac{-1}{\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}_{i}}\left(\boldsymbol{y}_{i}-2\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\frac{\left\Vert \boldsymbol{y}_{i}\right\Vert ^{2}}{\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}_{i}}\right)\cdot\boldsymbol{R}_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{i}=\frac{-1}{\left\Vert \boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\right\Vert min\left\{ \eta,\left\Vert \boldsymbol{R}_{i-1}\right\Vert \right\} }
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}=max\left\{ \beta_{i},\eta_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A limitation of this method is that the distance each node moves is proportional to the residual;
 stiffer nodes produce a larger residual for a given displacement and therefore move further,
 whereas in fact they need to move less than more compliant nodes.
 This results in mesh distortion where the element size varies,
 for midside nodes in quadratic elements or for mixed materials.
 This problem can be reduced by using a preconditioner,
 dividing the residual at each node by an estimate of its stiffness.
 This requires changes also to the calculation of β:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}=\frac{-1}{\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}_{i}}\left(\boldsymbol{y_{i}^{T}P}-2\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\frac{\boldsymbol{y_{i}^{T}Py}_{i}}{\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}_{i}}\right)\cdot\boldsymbol{R}_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{i}=0.4\frac{\Delta\boldsymbol{u}_{i-1}^{T}\boldsymbol{R}_{i}}{\boldsymbol{u_{i-1}^{T}P^{-1}u_{i-1}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}=max\left\{ \beta_{i},\eta_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{u}_{i+1}=\boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{R}_{i}+\beta_{i}\boldsymbol{u}_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preconditioner 
\series bold

 can be found in various ways;
 a convenient approximation is to use the reciprocal of the main diagonal of the stiffness matrix:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\boldsymbol{P}^{-1}=diag\left(\boldsymbol{K}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generalized 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-$
\end_inset

method is used for temporal discretization of governing equations in fluid mechanics.
 For this method we combine the degrees of freedom into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{n}=\left\{ \mathbf{v},J\right\} _{n}$
\end_inset

,
 where the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 denotes time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

;
 similarly,
 we let 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n}=\left\{ \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t},\frac{\partial J}{\partial t}\right\} _{n}$
\end_inset

.
 According to this method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Jansen00"
literal "true"

\end_inset

,
 the virtual work is evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W\left(\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}},\mathbf{Y}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+\alpha}=t_{n}+\alpha\Delta t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=t_{n+1}-t_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Here,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{Y}_{n+\alpha_{f}} & =\alpha_{f}\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}+\left(1-\alpha_{f}\right)\mathbf{Y}_{n}\\
\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}} & =\alpha_{m}\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+1}+\left(1-\alpha_{m}\right)\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n}
\end{aligned}
\,.\label{eq:ga-Y-Ydot}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{m}$
\end_inset

 are evaluated from a single parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 using
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{f}=\frac{1}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\quad\alpha_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{3-\rho_{\infty}}{1+\rho_{\infty}}\,,\label{eq:ga-alphas}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\rho_{\infty}\le1$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter is the spectral radius for an infinite time step,
 which controls the amount of damping of high frequencies;
 a value of zero produces the greatest amount of damping,
 anihilating the highest frequency in one step,
 whereas a value of one preserves the highest frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 so that the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W=0$
\end_inset

 produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Based on Newmark integration,
 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+1}=\frac{\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}-\mathbf{Y}_{n}}{\gamma\Delta t}-\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}-1\right)\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n}\,.\label{eq:ga-Newmark-integration}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where,
 according to the generalized 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-$
\end_inset

method,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\gamma=\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_{m}-\alpha_{f}\,.\label{eq:ga-ksi-gamma}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore,
 in this scheme,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated from
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}=\left(1-\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\gamma}\right)\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n}+\frac{\xi}{\Delta t}\left(\mathbf{Y}_{n+\alpha_{f}}-\mathbf{Y}_{n}\right)\,,\quad\xi\equiv\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\alpha_{f}\gamma}.\label{eq:ga-Ydot-evaluation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

,
 we find that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}D\mathbf{Y}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\left[\Delta\mathbf{Y}\right] & =\alpha_{f}\Delta\mathbf{Y}\\
D\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\mathbf{Y}\right] & =\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\gamma}\frac{\Delta\mathbf{Y}}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:ga-Y-Ydot-linearization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+\alpha_{m}},\mathbf{Y}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 the solution at 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated from
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\label{eq:ga-Y-updates}
\end{equation}

Four different options are presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for initializing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{Y}}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 at the beginning of time step 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+1}$
\end_inset

;
 the first three of these have been implemented in FEBio.
 For steady flows these authors recommend disregarding 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{f}=\alpha_{m}=\gamma=1$

 to recover the backward Euler scheme.

Solid Elements

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D solid elements available in FEBio are 
\emph on
isoparametric elements
\emph default
.
 All of the solid elements are formulated in a global Cartesian coordinate system.
 For all these elements,
 a local coordinate system (so-called 
\emph on
isoparametric coordinates
\emph default
) is defined as well.
 The global position vector 
\series bold

\end_inset


\series default
 can be written as a function of the isoparametric coordinates in the following sense:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}\left(r,s,t\right)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}N_{i}\left(r,s,t\right)\mathbf{x}_{i}.\label{eq373}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of nodes,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 are the isoparametric coordinates,
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the element shape functions and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the spatial coordinates of the element nodes.
 The same parametric interpolation is used for the interpolation of other scalar and vector quantities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All elements in FEBio are integrated numerically.
 This implies that integrals over the volume of the element 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{e}$
\end_inset

 are approximated by a sum:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{v^{e}}f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\,dv=\int\limits_{\Square^{e}}f\left({\mathbf{r}}\right)J(\mathbf{r})d\Square\,\cong\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}f\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)J_{i}w_{i}\,.\label{eq374}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Square$
\end_inset

 is the biunit cube,
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of integration points,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}_{i}$
\end_inset

are the location of the integration points in isoparametric coordinates,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}\left(r,s,t\right)$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a weight associated with the integration point.
 The integration is performed over the element's volume in the natural coordinate system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most fully integrated solid elements are unsuitable for the analysis of (nearly-) incompressible material behavior.
 To deal with this type of deformation,
 a three-field element implementation is available in FEBio

Shell Elements

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically,
 shells have been formulated using two different approaches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hughes80"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The difference between these approaches lies in the way the rotational degrees of freedom are defined.
 In the first approach,
 the rotational degrees of freedom are defined as angles.
 In addition,
 the plane stress condition needs to be enforced to take thickness variations into account.
 This approach is very useful for infinitesimal strains,
 but becomes very difficult to pursue in finite deformation due to the fact that finite rotations do not commute.
 Another disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a modification to the material formulation to enforce the plane stress condition.
 For complex materials this modification is very difficult or even impossible to obtain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The alternative approach is to use an 
\emph on
extensible director 
\emph default
to describe the rotational degrees of freedom.
 With this approach it is not necessary to enforce the plane-stress condition and the full 3D constitutive relations can be employed.
 This approach is adapted in FEBio as described here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shell formulation implemented in FEBio is still a work in progress.
 The goal is to implement an extensible director formulation with strain enhancements to deal with the well-known locking effect in incompressible and bending problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Betsch96"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 With the current state of the implementation,
 it is advised to use quadratic elements in such problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with FEBio 2.6,
 two shell formulations have become available:
 The original formulation,
 where nodes are located at the mid-surface through the thickness of the shell,
 and a new formulation where nodes are located on the front face of the shell.
 The original formulation uses nodal displacements and directors as degrees of freedom;
 the new formulation uses front and back face nodal displacements.
 The new formulation is designed to properly accommodate shells attached to the surface of a solid element,
 or shells sandwiched between two solid elements,
 with minimal alterations to the rest of the code.
 The original formulation does not strictly enforce continuity of all the relevant degrees of freedom in those situations.
 However,
 this original formulation is maintained in the code for backward compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the shell elements available in FEBio use a 
\emph on
compatible strain
\emph default
 formulation,
 where the calculation of strain components is based only on nodal displacements,
 similar to hexahedral or pentrahedral elements.
 Users should be aware that this compatible strain formulation is very susceptible to element locking when the shell thickness is much smaller than the shell size (e.g.,
 when the aspect ratio is less than 0.01).
 Therefore,
 these shell formulations should be used with caution,
 keeping in mind this important constraint.
 Conversely,
 these shell elements perform very well when they are attached to solid elements (e.g.,
 skin over muscle),
 or sandwiched between shell elements (e.g.,
 cell membrane separating cytoplasm from extra-cellular matrix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The element-locking limitation of compatible strain shell formulations has motivated the development of specialized shell formulations that attempt to overcome locking.
 The FE literature on this subject is rather extensive and we refer the reader to the excellent review chapter by Bischoff et al.

 which is otherwise substantially similar to the five-parameter interpolation presented in an earlier study by Klinkel et al.

.
 These shell elements are not suitable for attachment to a solid element,
 nor sandwiching between two solid elements.
 Since they don't experience element locking,
 they should be loaded more slowly than compatible strain shell elements.
 The formulations presented below are for the compatible strain shell elements.

\begin_layout Standard
We create a shell formulation by reducing a solid element interpolation which is linear along the parametric coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 We start with the general interpolation for a solid element,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\sum\limits_{a=1}^{n}N_{a}\left(\xi_{i}\right)\mathbf{x}_{a}\,,\label{eq380}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of nodes,
 and specialize it to the case of a shell as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{a}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1-\xi_{3}}{2}M_{a}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right) & 1\leqslant a\leqslant m\\
\frac{1+\xi_{3}}{2}M_{a}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right) & m+1\leqslant a\leqslant n
\end{cases}\,,\label{eq381}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1,2$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n/2$
\end_inset

 is the number of shell element nodes,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{a}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)$
\end_inset

 are the interpolation functions within the mid-shell surface.
 The description of the mid-shell surface is thus given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{x}}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)=\sum\limits_{a=1}^{n}N_{a}\left(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},0\right)\mathbf{x}_{a}\equiv\sum\limits_{b=1}^{m}M_{b}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{b}\,,\label{eq382}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{b}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{x}_{b}+\mathbf{x}_{b+m}\right)\label{eq383}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

are the nodal positions for the mid-shell surface.

We also define the director across the shell surface as

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{d}_{b}=\mathbf{x}_{b+m}-\mathbf{x}_{b},\quad b=1-m\label{eq385}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

are the nodal directors.
 Note that the magnitude of the nodal director represents the shell thickness,
 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)=\left\Vert \mathbf{d}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 and the shell thicknesses at the nodes are 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{b}=\left\Vert \mathbf{d}_{b}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 With these definitions we find that the interpolation across the parametric space of the shell element is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\mathbf{\hat{x}}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}\mathbf{d}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)=\sum\limits_{b=1}^{m}M_{b}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\left(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{b}+\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}\mathbf{d}_{b}\right)\,.\label{eq386}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From this relation we can obtain the covariant basis vectors as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}\left(\xi_{i}\right) & =\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial\xi_{\alpha}}=\sum\limits_{b=1}^{m}\frac{\partial M_{b}}{\partial\xi_{\alpha}}\left(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{b}+\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}\mathbf{d}_{b}\right)\\
\mathbf{g}_{3}\left(\xi_{i}\right) & =\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial\xi_{3}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{b=1}^{m}M_{b}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\mathbf{d}_{b}
\end{aligned}
\,,\label{eq387}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

from which we may evaluate the contravariant basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{j}$
\end_inset

 using the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{g}^{j}=\delta_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 the gradients of the shape functions are given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\grad M_{b}=\frac{\partial M_{b}}{\partial\xi_{\alpha}}\mathbf{g}^{\alpha},\quad\grad\left(\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}M_{b}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\xi_{3}\grad M_{b}+M_{b}\mathbf{g}^{3}\right)\,.\label{eq388}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq386"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 that the virtual displacement is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\mathbf{u}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\sum\limits_{a=1}^{m}M_{a}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\left(\delta\mathbf{\hat{u}}_{a}+\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}\delta\mathbf{d}_{a}\right)\,,\label{eq389}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the incremental displacement is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\mathbf{u}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\sum\limits_{b=1}^{m}M_{b}\left(\xi_{\alpha}\right)\left(\Delta\mathbf{\hat{u}}_{b}+\frac{1}{2}\xi_{3}\Delta\mathbf{d}_{b}\right)\,.\label{eq390}

\begin_layout Standard
In FEBio,
 for historical reasons,
 the nodal director 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}_{b}$
\end_inset

 is currently called 
\emph on
rotation
\emph default
.
 This is a misnomer and users should treat this 
\emph on
rotation
\emph default
 as the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}_{a}$
\end_inset

 whose components have units of length.
 Thus,
 fixing or prescribing 
\emph on
rotation
\emph default
 components in the input file effectively places these constraints on the components of the nodal director;
 similarly,
 requesting 
\emph on
rotation
\emph default
 in the output files will produce the components of the director.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this type of shell is connected face-to-face with a solid element,
 the nodes located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{b}$
\end_inset

 automatically share their displacement degrees of freedom 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{b}$
\end_inset

 with the corresponding nodes from the face of the solid element.
 However,
 no continuity is enforced between the directors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}_{b}$
\end_inset

 and the solid element deformation.
 One consequence of this condition is that a shell sandwiched between two solid elements will not detect out-of-plane shear and normal stresses transmitted by the solid element(s).
 Another consequence is that bending of the solid element(s) will not produce a bending moment in the shell.
 Therefore,
 these shell elements are best used as shell-only structures.

 The nodal positions at the back of the shell (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{3}=-1$

) are denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{a}$
\end_inset

 and those on the front of the shell (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{3}=+1$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{a}$

 thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\sum_{a}M_{a}\left(\xi_{1},\xi_{2}\right)\left(\frac{1+\xi_{3}}{2}\mathbf{x}_{a}+\frac{1-\xi_{3}}{2}\mathbf{y}_{a}\right)=\sum_{a}M_{a}\left(\xi_{1},\xi_{2}\right)\left(\mathbf{x}_{a}-\frac{1-\xi_{3}}{2}\mathbf{d}_{a}\right)\label{eq:solid-element-interpolation}

\begin_inset Formula

 Let the front-face and back-face displacements be denoted by

 respectively.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{a}=\mathbf{X}_{a}+\mathbf{u}_{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{a}=\mathbf{Y}_{a}+\mathbf{w}_{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{a}=\mathbf{X}_{a}-\mathbf{D}_{a}$
\end_inset

 is evaluated from the user-defined referential shell thickness,
 and the surface surface normals evaluated at each node.
 If the shell surface is not planar in the reference configuration,
 users must be careful to select shell thicknesses that don't produce inverted elements (negative Jacobians) as a result of this extrapolation.

External work of surface forces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that surface forces are applied on the shell front face (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{3}=+1$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore,
 the external work of surface forces has the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{ext}=\int_{\partial v}\delta\mathbf{u}\left(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},+1\right)\cdot\mathbf{t}\,da=\sum_{a}\delta\mathbf{u}_{a}\cdot\int_{\partial v}M_{a}\left(\xi_{1},\xi_{2}\right)\mathbf{t}\,da\label{eq:fbs-ext-work}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In other words,
 the treatment of surface forces on a shell becomes identical to the treatment of surface forces on the face of a solid.
 No special treatment is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shell on top of solid element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a shell is coincident with the face of a solid element,
 we assume that the face of the solid element coincides with the back face (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{3}=-1$
\end_inset

) of the shell element.
 This means that the solid element nodal displacements 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{b}$
\end_inset

 on that face coincide with the shell nodal displacements 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 when we use UnpackLM for those solid elements,
 we should reassign the DOF ID's of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{b}$
\end_inset

 displacements to those of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{b}$
\end_inset

 displacements stored in that same node.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shell sandwiched between solid elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a shell is sandwiched between two solid elements,
 we reassign the DOF ID's of the the solid 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{b}$
\end_inset

 displacements facing the back of the shell to those of the shell 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{b}$
\end_inset

 displacements stored in that same node.
 The DOF ID's of solid 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{b}$
\end_inset

 displacements facing the front of the shell remain unchanged;
 they will coincide with those of the corresponding solid element nodes.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Rigid-Shell Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the node of a deformable shell belongs to a rigid body,
 we need to substitute the nodal degrees of freedom with the rigid body degrees of freedom.
 The positions of the shell front face and back face nodes are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{x}_{b} & =\mathbf{r}+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\cdot\left(\mathbf{X}_{b}-\mathbf{R}\right)\equiv\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{a}_{b}\\
\mathbf{y}_{b} & =\mathbf{r}+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\cdot\left(\mathbf{Y}_{b}-\mathbf{R}\right)\equiv\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{b}_{b}
\end{aligned}
\,,\label{eq:fbs-rigid-shell}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

 is the current position of the rigid body center of mass and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is its initial position;
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$
\end_inset

 is the rotation tensor for the rigid body.
 We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{b}$
\end_inset

 are connected to the same rigid body.
 From these relations it follows that virtual displacements are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta\mathbf{u}_{a} & =\delta\mathbf{r}-\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{a}\cdot\delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\\
\delta\mathbf{w}_{b} & =\delta\mathbf{r}-\hat{\mathbf{b}}_{a}\cdot\delta\boldsymbol{\theta}
\end{aligned}
\,,\label{eq:fbs-rsi-virtual}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and incremental displacements are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\Delta\mathbf{u}_{b} & =\Delta\mathbf{r}-\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{b}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\\
\Delta\mathbf{w}_{b} & =\Delta\mathbf{r}-\hat{\mathbf{b}}_{b}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}
\end{aligned}
\,,\label{eq:fbs-rsi-incremental}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 is the skew-symmetric tensor whose dual vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{a}}\cdot\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 When nodes are flexible (when they do not belong to any rigid body),
 the virtual work has the general form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W=\sum_{a=1}^{m}\delta\mathbf{u}_{a}\cdot\mathbf{f}_{a}^{u}+\delta\mathbf{w}_{a}\cdot\mathbf{f}_{a}^{w}+\delta p_{a}\,f_{a}^{p}=\sum_{a=1}^{m}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\delta\mathbf{v}_{a} & \delta\mathbf{w}_{a} & \delta p_{a}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{f}_{a}^{u}\\
\mathbf{f}_{a}^{w}\\
f_{a}^{p}
\end{array}\right]\,,\label{eq:fbs-rsi-work}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 denotes any additional degree-of-freedom at that node.
 If node 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is rigid we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\delta\mathbf{u}_{a} & \delta\mathbf{w}_{a} & \delta p_{a}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\delta\mathbf{r} & \delta\boldsymbol{\theta} & \delta p_{a}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{I} & \mathbf{0}\\
\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{a} & \hat{\mathbf{b}}_{a} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & 1
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq:fbs-rsi-a-rigid}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If node 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is rigid we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\Delta\mathbf{u}_{b}\\
\Delta\mathbf{w}_{b}\\
\Delta p_{b}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathbf{I} & -\hat{\mathbf{a}}_{b} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{I} & -\hat{\mathbf{b}}_{b} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\Delta\mathbf{r}\\
\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\\
\Delta p_{b}
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq:fbs-rsi-b-rigid}

\end_inset

When node 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 belongs to a rigid body,
 the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W$
\end_inset

 must be substituted with
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
In the theory of linear elasticity the Cauchy stress tensor is a linear function of the small strain tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,.\label{eq402}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$
\end_inset

 is the fourth-order elasticity tensor that contains the material properties.
 In the most general case this tensor has 21 independent parameters.
 However,
 in the presence of material symmetry the number of independent parameters is greatly reduced.
 For example,
 in the case of isotropic linear elasticity only two independent parameters remain.
 In this case,
 the elasticity tensor is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}=\lambda\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}+2\mu\mathbf{I}\,\overline{\underline{\otimes}}\,\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

,
 or equivalently,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}_{ijkl}=\lambda\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}+\mu\left(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}+\delta_{il}\delta_{jk}\right)\,.\label{eq403}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The material coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 are known as the Lamé parameters.
 Using this equation,
 the stress-strain relationship can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij}=\lambda\varepsilon_{kk}\delta_{ij}+2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\,.\label{eq404}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If the stress and strain are represented inVoigt notation,
 the constitutive equation can be rewritten in matrix form as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{11}\\
\sigma_{22}\\
\sigma_{33}\\
\sigma_{12}\\
\sigma_{23}\\
\sigma_{13}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
\lambda+2\mu & \lambda & \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0\\

The theoretical range of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for an isotropic material have the ranges 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

Materials with Poisson's ratio (close to) 0.5 are known as (nearly-) incompressible materials.
 For these materials,
 the bulk modulus approaches infinity.
 Most materials have a positive Poisson's ratio.
 However there do exist some materials with a negative ratio.
 These materials are known as 
\emph on

The linear stress-strain relationship can also be derived from a strain-energy function such as in the case of hyperelastic materials.
 In this case the linear strain-energy is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}:\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,.\label{eq408}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The stress is then similarly derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\frac{\partial W}{\partial\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}}$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of isotropic elasticity,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This model is objective for large strains and rotations.
 For the isotropic case it can be derived from the following hyperelastic strain-energy function:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{1}{2}\lambda\left(\tr\mathbf{E}\right)^{2}+\mu\mathbf{E}:\mathbf{E}\,.\label{eq411}

The second Piola-Kirchhoff stress can be derived from this:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}=\frac{\partial W}{\partial\mathbf{E}}=\lambda\left(\tr\mathbf{E}\right)\mathbf{I}+2\mu\mathbf{E}\,.\label{eq412}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 except that the small strain tensor is replaced by the Green-Lagrange elasticity tensor 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

.
 The material elasticity tensor is then given by,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\mathbb{C}}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{S}}{\partial\mathbf{E}}=\lambda\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}+2\mu\mathbf{I}\odot\mathbf{I}\,.\label{eq413}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is important to note that although this model is objective,
 it should only be used for small strains.
 For large strains,
 the response can be somewhat strange if not completely unrealistic.
 For example,
 it can be shown that under uni-axial tension the stress becomes infinite and the volume tends to zero for finite strains.
 Therefore,
 for large strains it is highly recommended to avoid this material and instead use one of the other non-linear material models described below.
 The Cauchy stress is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\frac{1}{J}\left(\lambda\tr\mathbf{E}-\mu\right)\mathbf{b}+\frac{\mu}{J}\mathbf{b}^{2}\,,\label{eq414}

\end{aligned}
\label{eq427}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{i}=\mathbf{n}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{i}$

 In the limit when eigenvalues coincide,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim\limits_{\lambda_{j}\to\lambda_{i}}2\frac{\sigma_{i}\lambda_{j}^{2}-\sigma_{j}\lambda_{i}^{2}}{\lambda_{i}^{2}-\lambda_{j}^{2}}=2c_{p}\left(1-J\right)+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}\frac{1}{J}\frac{c_{k}}{m_{k}}\left[2+\left(m_{k}-2\right)\lambda_{i}^{m_{k}}\right]\,.\label{eq428}

In the reference configuration the elasticity tensor reduces to

 This can be derived from the following hyperelastic strain-energy function:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=\sum\limits_{a=1}^{3}\mu_{a}\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{aa}\left[\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}\right]\left(\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}\right)+\sum\limits_{b=1,\,b\ne a}^{3}\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{ab}\left(\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}\right)\left(\mathbf{A}_{b}^{0}:\mathbf{E}\right)\,,\label{eq434}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}=\mathbf{a}_{a}^{0}\otimes\mathbf{a}_{a}^{0}$

 is the structural tensor corresponding to one of the three mutually orthogonal planes of symmetry whose unit outward normal is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{a}^{0}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{a}^{0}\cdot\mathbf{a}_{b}^{0}=\delta_{ab})$

 The bimodular response is described by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{aa}\left[\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}\right]=\begin{cases}

\lambda_{-aa} & \mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}:\mathbf{E}<0

The material constants are the three shear moduli

 The second Piola-Kirchhoff stress can be derived from this strain energy density function:
 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin{aligned}\mathbf{S} & =\frac{\partial W}{\partial\mathbf{E}}=\sum\limits_{a=1}^{3}\mu_{a}\left(\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}\cdot\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{A}_{a}^{0}\right)\\

It is important to note that although this model is objective,
 it should only be used for small strains.
 For large strains,
 the response may be unrealistic.
 The Cauchy stress is

In the limit of infinitesimal strains and rotations,
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J=1$
\end_inset

,
 we find that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}f\left(1\right) & =\mu & J\frac{dg}{dJ} & =\mu\frac{\left(2\varphi_{r}^{s}-3\right)\varphi_{r}^{s}}{3\left(1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\right)^{2}}\\
g\left(J\right) & =\mu\frac{\varphi_{r}^{s}}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}} & J\frac{dh}{dJ} & =\mu\frac{\varphi_{r}^{s}}{\left(1-\varphi_{r}^{s}\right)^{2}}\\
h\left(J\right) & =-\mu\frac{1}{1-\varphi_{r}^{s}}\mu
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}=\frac{2\mu}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\left(\varphi_{r}^{w}\right)^{2}}-1\right)\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}+2\mu\mathbf{I}\odot\mathbf{I}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Thus,
 by comparison to a standard neo-Hookean material,
 this porous neo-Hookean material has an effective Young's modulus equal to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=\frac{3\mu}{1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{r}^{w}\right)^{2}}\,,
\]

\end_inset

and an effective Poisson's ratio equal to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu=\frac{1-\left(\varphi_{r}^{w}\right)^{2}}{2+\left(\varphi_{r}^{w}\right)^{2}}\,.
\]

\end_inset

The two material properties that need to be provided are 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and the referential porosity 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{w}$
\end_inset

 (or referential solid volume fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{s}=1-\varphi_{r}^{w}$
\end_inset

).
 Poisson's ratio in the limit of infinitesimal strains is dictated by the porosity according to the above formula.
 In particular,
 a highly porous material (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{w}\to1$
\end_inset

) has an effective (infinitesimal strain) Poisson ratio that approaches zero (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\to0$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $E\to2\mu$
\end_inset

.
 A low porosity material (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{w}\to0$
\end_inset

) has 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\to\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E\to3\mu$
\end_inset

,
 which is the expected behavior of an incompressible neo-Hookean solid.
 Note that setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{w}=0$
\end_inset

 would not produce good numerical behavior,
 since the Cauchy stress in an incompressible material would need to be supplemented by a pressure term (a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the incompressibility constraint).
 Nevertheless,
 this compressible porous neo-Hookean material behaves well even for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{w}$
\end_inset

 as low as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.015$
\end_inset

The cell growth material implements a swelling pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi=RT\left(\frac{c_{r}}{J-\varphi_{r}^{s}}-c_{e}\right)\,.
\]

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r}$
\end_inset

 represents the referential molar concentration of intracellular solutes (moles of solutes per mixture volume in the reference configuration),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the referential intracellular solid volume fraction,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J=\det\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 is the determinant of the deformation gradient,
 representing the volume ratio in the current configuration.
 The extracellular osmolarity is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 This model assumes that neither intracellular solutes nor extracellular solutes may transport across the cell membrane passively.
 When a cell divides,
 it must use active transport mechanisms to bring in membrane-impermeant extracellular solutes inside,
 some of which are converted into intracellular solid matrix (e.g.,
 cytoskeletal structures).
 As the intracellular osmolarity increases,
 water is transported into the cell,
 thus causing it to swell.
 The process of cell division is not modeled explicitly in this continuum representation,
 though the net effect is that cell proliferation leads to an increase in intracellular osmotic pressure,
 which generally translates into an increase in volume (unless the cell growth is constrained significantly).
 In a cell growth model,
 the initial condition (when 
\begin_inset Formula $J=1$
\end_inset

) should be selected for 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{r}^{s}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=0$

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial J}=-RT\frac{J}{\left(J-\varphi_{r}^{s}\right)^{2}}c_{r}\,.
\]

\end_inset

This elasticity tensor has the same form as that of an isotropic elastic material whose effective Young's modulus 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{Y}$
\end_inset

 and Poisson's ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\nu & =\frac{\pi+J\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial J}}{2J\frac{\partial\pi}{\partial J}}
\end{aligned}
\,.

This material model describes a constitutive model for fibers,

 The Cauchy stress is given by:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=2J^{-1}H\left(I_{n}-I_{0}\right)I_{n}\frac{\partial\Psi_{r}}{\partial I_{n}}\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}\,,\label{eq:fepl-stress}

\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}=\lambda_{n}^{2}=\mathbf{n}_{r}\cdot\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 is the square of the fiber stretch,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 is the fiber orientation in the reference configuration,
 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}/\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is the unit step function that enforces the tension-only contribution.
 Thus,
 the stress and elasticity tensors are non-zero only when 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}>I_{0}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}=\lambda_{0}^{2}$

 is the square of the stretch at which the fiber's tensile response engages.
 By default we may take 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 though the actual value of 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 may be set by the user.
 The fiber strain energy density is given by 
\begin_inset Formula

 It can be used to model tissues such as tendons,
 ligaments and muscle.
 The elastic response of the tissue is assumed to arise from the resistance of the fiber family and an isotropic matrix.
 It is assumed that the strain energy function can be written as follows:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=F_{1}\left(\tilde{I}_{1},\tilde{I}_{2}\right)+F_{2}\left(\tilde{\lambda}\right)+\frac{K}{2}\left[\ln\left(J\right)\right]^{2}\,.\label{eq463}

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is the initial fiber direction).
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

 represents the material response of the isotropic ground substance matrix,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}$
\end_inset

represents the contribution from the fiber family.
 The strain energy of the fiber family is as follows:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\lambda}\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial\tilde{\lambda}}=\begin{cases}
0 & \tilde{\lambda}\leqslant1\\

\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $C_{4}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{5}$

When some of the energy stored during mechanical loading of a material gets dissipated into heat,
 the material's response is called inelastic.
 Inelastic behaviors include viscoelasticity and plasticity,
 although this presentation focuses exclusively on viscoelasticity.
 In continuum mechanics,
 we can identify three forms of viscoelasticity in materials.
 Viscoelasticity may occur due to (1) friction between molecules of the same material,
 (2) friction between solid and fluid matter in a porous deformable medium,
 and (3) breaking and reforming of weak bonds between molecules of the same material.
 The first form is classically described as the viscous response of a material,
 whereby the friction between molecules of the same material is represented by the material's viscosity

 By recognizing that

 we use eq.

For example,
 in the special case of a stress-relaxation response to an instantaneous step strain,
 evaluated from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}\left(0^{+}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 we may let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{s}\left(0^{+}\right)=\mathbf{F}\left(0^{+}\right)$
\end_inset

 since the dashpot cannot deform instantaneously,
 under the reasonable constitutive assumption that there is no rigid body rotation associated with the dashpot distinct from that of the Maxwell series spring,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{d}\left(0^{+}\right)=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

.
 If we adopt this assumption for all times 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
 then we can also conclude that the right stretch tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{s}$
\end_inset

 of the Maxwell spring deformation gradient tends toward 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 in the limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to\infty$
\end_inset

,
 as the dashpot elongates or contracts to match the right-stretch tensor of the parallel spring,
 also implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{r}^{e}\left(\mathbf{F}_{s}\right)\to0$
\end_inset

 in this limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building upon this example,
 we can assume more generally that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{U}_{s}\cdot\mathbf{U}_{d}$
\end_inset

 under the constitutive assumption that the rotation tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 in the polar decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 is the same in both branches of the microstructural model.
 However,
 for self-consistency,
 we must also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{d}$
\end_inset

 share the same eigenvectors as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 to preserve the symmetry of all three right-stretch tensors.
 Thus,
 a valid constitutive model for the multiplicative decomposition is to let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{s}=\mathbf{U}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{d}=\mathbf{U}^{1-\alpha}$
\end_inset

,
 where the exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function of time that can be obtained by solving eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:IVT-total-stress"

 in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\mathbf{S}^{e}\left(\mathbf{U}^{\alpha}\right)=\mathbf{S}\left(\mathbf{U}\right)-\mathbf{S}^{e}\left(\mathbf{U}\right)$
\end_inset

 at the current time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This constitutive model is insensitive to flipping the spring and dashopt sequence in the Maxwell element,
 as should be expected.
 Now,
 for an instantaneous step strain,
 we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(0^{+}\right)=1$
\end_inset

,
 whereas the steady-state response to a step strain would produce 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{t\to\infty}\alpha\left(t\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Logically,
 it would be reasonable to expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 must remain in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\alpha\le1$
\end_inset

,
 since we cannot physically justify that the Maxwell spring would stretch (expand or contract) by a greater amount than the parallel spring.

Here we consider the slightly more general case where the relaxation function is given by a Prony series

With this function chosen for the relaxation function,
 we can write the total stress as 
\begin_inset Formula

we can rewrite 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as follows,
 
\begin_inset Formula

The question now remains how to evaluate the internal variables.
 From equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq488"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 it appears that we have to integrate over the entire time domain.
 However,
 we can find a recurrence relationship that will allow us to evaluate the internal variables at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\Delta t$
\end_inset

 given the values at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{H}^{\left(i\right)}\left(t+\Delta t\right) & =\int\limits_{0}^{t+\Delta t}\exp\left[-\left(t+\Delta t-s\right)/\tau_{i}\right]\frac{d\mathbf{S}^{e}}{ds}\,ds\\
 & =\exp\left(-\Delta t/\tau_{i}\right)\int\limits_{0}^{t}\exp\left[-\left(t-s\right)/\tau_{i}\right]\frac{d\mathbf{S}^{e}}{ds}\,ds+\int\limits_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\exp\left[-\left(t+\Delta t-s\right)/\tau_{i}\right]\frac{d\mathbf{S}^{e}}{ds}\,ds\\
 & =\exp\left(-\Delta t/\tau_{i}\right)\mathbf{H}^{\left(i\right)}\left(t\right)+\int\limits_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\exp\left[-\left(t+\Delta t-s\right)/\tau_{i}\right]\frac{d\mathbf{S}^{e}}{ds}\,ds\,.
\end{aligned}
\label{eq490}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The last term can now be simplified using the midpoint rule to approximate the derivate.
 In that case we find the recurrence relation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}^{\left(i\right)}\left(t+\Delta t\right)=\exp\left(-\Delta t/\tau_{i}\right)\mathbf{H}^{\left(i\right)}\left(t\right)+\frac{1-\exp\left(-\Delta t/\tau_{i}\right)}{\Delta t/\tau_{i}}\left(\mathbf{S}^{e}\left(t+\Delta t\right)-\mathbf{S}^{e}\left(t\right)\right)\,.\label{eq491}

\mathbf{F}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)=\mathbf{F}^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)\cdot\bar{\mathbf{R}}\left(\mathbf{X},u\right)\cdot\mathbf{U}\left(\mathbf{X},u\right)\,,\label{eq492}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 is the right-stretch tensor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{R}}=\left(\mathbf{R}^{u}\right)^{T}\cdot\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is the relative rotation between generation 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and the master generation.
 The strain energy density 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{r}$
\end_inset

 in a reactive viscoelastic material is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{r}\left(\mathbf{F}\right)=\Psi_{r}^{e}\left(\mathbf{F}\right)+\sum\limits_{u}w^{u}\Psi_{0}^{b}\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\right)\,,\label{eq493}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{r}^{e}$
\end_inset

 is the strain energy density of strong bonds and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{0}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is the strain energy density of weak bonds,
 when they all belong to the same generation.
 In this expression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the mass fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $u-$
\end_inset

generation weak bonds,
 which evolves over time as described below.
 The summation is taken over all generations

 the mixture Cauchy stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in a reactive viscoelastic material is similarly given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)=\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)+\sum\limits_{u}w^{u}J^{-1}\left(u\right)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{b}\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\right)\,,\label{eq494}
\end{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$
\end_inset

 is the stress in the strong bonds and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is the stress in the weak bonds.
 These stresses are related to the respective strain energy densities of strong and weak bonds according to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)=\frac{1}{J^{s}}\frac{\partial\Psi_{r}^{e}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)}{\partial\mathbf{F}^{s}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)^{T},\quad\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}^{b}\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\right)=\frac{1}{J^{u}}\frac{\partial\Psi_{0}^{b}\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\right)}{\partial\mathbf{F}^{u}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\right)^{T}\,.\label{eq495}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The mass fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)$
\end_inset

 are obtained by solving the equation of mass balance for reactive constrained mixtures,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{w}^{u}=\hat{w}^{u}\left(\mathbf{F},w^{\gamma}\right)\,,\label{eq496}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the mass fraction supply 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{w}^{u}$
\end_inset

 must be specified as a constitutive function of the deformation gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 and the mass fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 from all generations.
 Since mass must be conserved over all generations,
 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{u}\hat{w}^{u}=0,\quad\sum\limits_{u}w^{u}=1\,.\label{eq497}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Any number of valid solutions may exist for 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{u}$
\end_inset

,
 based on constitutive assumptions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{w}^{u}$
\end_inset

.
 For example,
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $u-$
\end_inset

generation bonds reforming in an unloaded state during the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $u\leqslant t<v$
\end_inset

,
 and subsequently breaking in response to loading at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=v$
\end_inset

,
 Type I bond kinetics provides a solution of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & t<u\\
f^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right) & u\leqslant t<v\\
f^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},v\right)g\left(\mathbf{F}\left(v\right);\mathbf{X},t-v\right) & v\leqslant t
\end{cases}\,,\label{eq498}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f^{u}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)=1-\sum\limits_{\gamma<u}w^{\gamma}\left(\mathbf{X},t\right)\,,\label{eq499}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(\mathbf{F}\left(v\right);\mathbf{X},t-v\right)$
\end_inset

 is a reduced relaxation function which may assume any number of valid forms.
 (A reduced relaxation function 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(0\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(t\to\infty\right)=0$
\end_inset

,
 and decreases monotonically with 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.) In particular,
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 may depend on the state of strain at time 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 when the 
\begin_inset Formula $u-$
\end_inset

generation starts breaking and reforming.
 In the recursive expression of eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
 the earliest generation 
\begin_inset Formula $u=-\infty$
\end_inset

,
 which is initially at rest,
 produces 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{u}\left(t\right)=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{u}\left(t\right)=g\left(\mathbf{F}\left(v\right);\mathbf{X},t-v\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\geqslant v$
\end_inset

;
 this latter expression seeds the recursion for subsequent generations.
 Therefore,
 providing a functional form for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 suffices to produce the solution for all bond generations 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Type II bond kinetics,
 the solution for the mass fractions is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w^{u}\left(t\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & t<u\\
1-g\left(t-u\right) & u\leqslant t<v\\
g\left(t-v\right)-g\left(t-u\right) & v\leqslant t
\end{cases}\,.\label{eq500}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For this type of bond kinetics,
 the reduced relaxation function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 cannot depend on the magnitude of the strain,
 because strain-dependence might violate the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leqslant w^{u}\leqslant1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 type II bond kinetics is only valid for quasilinear viscoelasticity,
 whereas type I bond kinetics also encompasses nonlinear viscoelasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all bond kinetics,
 it is also possible to constrain the occurrence of the breaking-and-reforming reaction to specific forms of the strain.
 For example,
 the reaction may be allowed to proceed only in the case of dilatational strain,
 or only in the case of distortional strain.

In reactive viscoelasticity we adopt the constitutive assumption that

 it remains valid for all material symmetries,

\begin_layout Standard
There remains one special case that must be addressed with a separate choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{R}}$
\end_inset

.
 In biomechanics we often find it convenient to model fibrous or fibrillar materials using one-dimensional fibers that can only sustain tension.
 Typically,
 such fibers are represented with a strain energy density function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\Psi_{0}\left(\mathbf{C}\right) & =H\left(I_{n}-1\right)\Psi_{n}\left(I_{n}\right)\,, & I_{n} & =\mathbf{n}_{r}\cdot\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}\end{aligned}
\label{eq:A-fiber-models}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 is the unit vector along the fiber in its reference configuration,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the square of the stretch ratio along the fiber.
 The Heaviside unit step function 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(I_{n}-1\right)$
\end_inset

 in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:A-fiber-models"

\end_inset

 ensures that the fiber contributes strain energy only when it is under tension (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}>1$
\end_inset

);
 thus,
 the constitutive model 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{n}\left(I_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 for the tensile response of the fiber must reduce to zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the reactive viscoelasticity framework,
 each generation 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 comes into existence at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{u}$
\end_inset

,
 thus the constitutive model for the fiber must account for the fact that the fiber orientation is no longer along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed,
 the total weak bond free energy in a reactive viscoelastic material now reduces to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\sum_{u}w^{u}\Psi_{0}^{b}\left(\mathbf{F}^{u}\left(t\right)\right) & =\sum_{u}w^{u}H\left(I_{n}^{u}-1\right)\Psi_{n}\left(I_{n}^{u}\right)\\
I_{n}^{u} & =\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}\cdot\mathbf{C}^{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:A-fiber-SED}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}$
\end_inset

 is the fiber orientation at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}^{u}$
\end_inset

 is the square of the stretch ratio of the fiber relative to its reference configuration at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that the elemental line along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 gets transformed in the material frame at any time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{U}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\lambda_{n} & =\sqrt{\mathbf{n}_{r}\cdot\mathbf{C}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}}\,, & \mathbf{n} & =\frac{1}{\lambda_{n}}\mathbf{U}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}\end{aligned}
\label{eq:A-fiber-current}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

At time 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{u}$
\end_inset

 when generation 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 forms in a stress-free state,
 it follows that the fiber material is now based on the orientation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}\equiv\mathbf{n}\left(t^{u}\right)$

 evaluated using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}\left(\mathbf{X},t^{u}\right)$

 In general,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 need not be collinear,
 therefore we can find the rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{R}}$
\end_inset

 that transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mathbf{R}}=\left(1-\cos\gamma\right)\mathbf{m}\otimes\mathbf{m}+\cos\gamma\mathbf{I}-\mathbb{E}\cdot\left(\sin\gamma\,\mathbf{m}\right)\label{eq:A-R-fiber}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\gamma=\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\gamma\,\mathbf{m}=\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}\times\mathbf{n}_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 In this expression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}$
\end_inset

 is the unit vector along the rotation axis,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the rotation angle about the axis,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}$
\end_inset

 represents the (pseudo-)third-order permutation tensor whose components are equal to the permutation symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ijk}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbb{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is the antisymmetric second-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 whose dual vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}$
\end_inset

 from which it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot\mathbf{a}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Here again,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{R}}$
\end_inset

 represents a relative rotation between the material vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{r}^{u}$
\end_inset

 it is invariant to any transformation

 The simplest and most commonly used relaxation function is the exponential function 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(t\right)=e^{-t/\tau}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the relaxation constant.
 In viscoelasticity theory it is common to use a combination of relaxation functions with distinct relaxation constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 described as a Prony series of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g\left(t\right)=\frac{\sum_{i}\gamma_{i}e^{-t/\tau_{i}}}{\sum_{i}\gamma_{i}}\,.\label{eq:rrf-Prony}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are normalized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 to enforce 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(0\right)=1$
\end_inset

 Alternatively,
 we could have written
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g\left(t\right)=\sum_{i}\hat{\gamma}_{i}e^{-t/\tau_{i}}\,,\quad\sum_{i}\hat{\gamma}_{i}=1\,.\label{eq:rrf-Prony-alt}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This type of relaxation function 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is said to have a discrete spectrum of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}_{i}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to each

To satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(0\right)=1$

 the continous relaxation spectrum

 is the viscous stress,
 which depends on the rate of deformation tensor

 For example,
 in an isotropic Newtonian viscous response,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}=\lambda\left(\text{tr}\mathbf{D}\right)\mathbf{I}+2\mu\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 Since

 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{e}$

 For a viscous fluid,

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}^{\alpha}$

 is the material associated with bonds

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=i$
\end_inset

 for intact bonds and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=b$
\end_inset

 for broken bonds).
 The material is modeled as a constrained mixture of these two constituents 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Whereas intact bonds may store free energy,
 broken bond sustain none.
 This framework assumes that isothermal conditions prevail.
 Thus,
 any heat generated by the dissipative damage reaction must be radiated from the continuum to preserve a constant temperature.
 In an isothermal framework,
 the free energy density is also equal to the strain energy density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The referential mass density of the solid mixture is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}$
\end_inset

 (mass of solid per volume in its referential,
 stress-free configuration),
 which remains constant throughout an analysis.
 The material associated with intact bonds has an apparent mass density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{i}$
\end_inset

 while that associated with broken bonds is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{b},$
\end_inset

such that the mixture mass balance is satisfied by

Let the specific free energy stored in intact bonds be represented by

 that of broken bonds is zero.
 Therefore,
 the free energy density of the mixture is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{r}\left(\mathbf{F}\right)=\rho_{r}^{i}\psi\left(\mathbf{F}\right)\,.\label{eq:dmg-FED}

We may define the mass fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w^{i}+w^{b}=1\,.\label{eq:dmg-massfraction-balance}

 The corresponding Cauchy stress may be evaluated using the standard hyperelasticity formula,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=J^{-1}\frac{\partial\Psi_{r}}{\partial\mathbf{F}}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{T}=\left(1-w^{b}\right)\frac{\rho_{r}}{J}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathbf{F}}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{T}.\label{eq:dmg-stress}

\end_inset

These relation show that the free energy density and stress of a damaged material are scaled by the mass fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{i}=1-w^{b}$
\end_inset

 of remaining intact bonds.
 Comparing these formulas to those of classical damage mechanics

 it becomes immediately apparent that the classical damage variable 
\begin_inset Formula $D$

 appearing in those theories is equivalent to the mass fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{b}$
\end_inset

 of broken bonds,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\equiv w^{b}.\label{eq:dmg-variable}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To further clarify this equivalence,
 we may let

At each material point

The scalar damage measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi\left(\mathbf{F}\right)$
\end_inset

 must be invariant to orthogonal transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$

 that preserve material symmetry,
 or else the damage formulation would not be observer-independent.
 For example,
 for isotropic materials,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi\left(\mathbf{F}\right)$
\end_inset

 must be an isotropic function of the deformation,
 in which case it should be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi\left(\mathbf{U}\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi\left(\mathbf{E}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 of the deformation gradient,
 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{F}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{F}-\mathbf{I}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{U}^{2}-\mathbf{I}\right)\label{eq:Lagrange-strain-tensor}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is the Green-Lagrange strain tensor.
 It follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial\mathbf{U}}\right)_{ijmn}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{im}U_{nj}+\delta_{in}U_{mj}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(U_{im}\delta_{jn}+U_{in}\delta_{jm}\right)\right)\,.

The axiom of mass balance in a reactive constrained mixture reduces to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho}_{r}^{\alpha}=\hat{\rho}_{r}^{\alpha}\,,\label{eq:dmg-mass-balance-alpha}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\rho}_{r}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the material time derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}^{\alpha}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}_{r}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is a function of state representing the referential mass supply density to constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 due to reactions with all other constituents.
 In the damage framework,
 the above relations show that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\rho_{r}^{i} & =\rho_{r}\left(1-F\left(\Xi_{m}\right)\right)\\
\rho_{r}^{b} & =\rho_{r}F\left(\Xi_{m}\right)

In these expressions,
 the damage is advancing when

 In this expression for

In this isothermal damage framework it can be shown from the energy balance that a heat supply density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}r$

 must radiate the bond-breaking energy out of the continuum to maintain isothermal conditions,

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Xi_{m}$
\end_inset

 its material time derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{F}$

 Since the specific strain energy 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(\mathbf{F}\right)$

 it follows that the specific heat supply 
\begin_inset Formula $r=-\dot{F}\left(\Xi_{m}\right)\psi\left(\mathbf{F}\right)$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 has considered an elastic-perfectly plastic response,
 i.e.,
 all the bonds yield when a single yield threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{m}$
\end_inset

 is met.
 However,
 a wealth of experimental results show a more progressive yielding,
 rather than a sudden onset,
 and an increase in the stress with increasing plastic deformation,
 a phenomenon alternately termed strain hardening or work hardening.
 Real materials typically exhibit the Bauschinger effect,
 where loading to yield in one direction changes the yield threshold in the reverse direction.
 The hardening behavior that accounts for this effect is known as kinematic hardening;
 for a load reversal,
 it predicts yielding occurs when the change in load achieves twice the monotonic yield strength.
 The reactive plasticity framework can be extended to allow for kinematic hardening by introducing multiple families of bonds.
 In the current FEBio implementation each bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 shares the same yield criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 but distinct associated yield thresholds 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{m\beta}$
\end_inset

,
 and it follows the elastic-perfectly plastic behavior for multiple generations outlined in Section
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The superposition of multiple bond families 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in parallel naturally develops behavior consistent with kinematic hardening,
 as different bond families yield at different thresholds.

 which may yield under different thresholds,
 where each bond family may evolve over multiple generations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 This framework requires us to update our notation to include a subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for suitable variables introduced in the presentation above.
 In particular,
 the reference configuration of generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is now denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{\beta}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding deformation gradient is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 We assume that the free energy density of each bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{\beta r}=J_{\beta}^{\sigma s}\Psi_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 when the mixture consists entirely of bonds of family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 The master reference configuration of all bond families remains 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{s}$
\end_inset

 and the associated (total) deformation gradient is still 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}^{s}$
\end_inset

 Therefore,
 each bond family

 we define

w_{\beta}\equiv\frac{\rho_{r\beta}}{\rho_{r}}\,,\quad\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}=1\,,\label{eq:multiplebonds-family-mass-balance}

which represents the mass fraction of each bond family

which represents the mass fraction of each generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 within the bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 From these definitions,
 it follows that bond family mass fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 are time-invariant (thus user-selected for a particular material response),
 whereas generation mass fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{\sigma}$

\end_inset

whereas the mixture stress is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}\underbrace{\sum_{\sigma}w_{\beta}^{\sigma}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}\right)}_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\beta}}\,,\quad\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}\right)=\frac{1}{J_{\beta}^{\sigma}}\frac{\partial\Psi_{0}}{\partial\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}\right)^{T}\,.\label{eq:multiplebonds-mixture-stress}

To simplify the remainder of this presentation,
 we introduce the concept of 
\shape italic
yielded bonds
\shape default
,
 denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 to represent bonds of the current extant generation in a plasticity formulation.
 The yielded bond fraction for each family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{\beta}^{y}=\sum_{\sigma\neq s}w_{\beta}^{\sigma}=1-w_{\beta}^{s}\label{eq:hardening-yielded-mass-fraction}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the summation runs over all possible yielded generations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\neq s$
\end_inset

 In particular,
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=u$

 eq.

LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 reduces to the statement 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{y}=w_{\beta}^{u}$
\end_inset

 We then define the relative deformation gradient of yielded bonds as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{y}$
\end_inset

,
 which equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 for the extant generation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 With these notational changes,
 we may write the yielding reactions in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}^{s}\to\underbrace{\mathcal{E}^{u}\rightarrow\mathcal{E}^{v}\rightarrow\dots}_{\mathcal{E}^{y}}\,.\label{eq:hardening-yielded-rxn}

 may be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\beta}=w_{\beta}^{s}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)+\left(1-w_{\beta}^{s}\right)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{y}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We may also define the total fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}$
\end_inset

 of intact bonds in the mixture as 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}=\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}w_{\beta}^{s}$
\end_inset

,
 and the total fraction of yielded bonds as 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{y}=\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}w_{\beta}^{y}=1-w^{s}$
\end_inset

,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}+w^{y}=1$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}=w^{s}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s}\right)+\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}\left(1-w_{\beta}^{s}\right)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{0}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{y}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The summation in this last expression does not simplify further since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{y}$
\end_inset

 is different for each bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 the material either behaves as if it is perfectly plastic (a scenario which may be valid around the ultimate strength,

 In our treatment of elastoplastic damage we assume that both intact and yielded bonds may become damaged.
 Damage to intact bonds may represent some initial damage value for a material with defects,
 or damage due to intermolecular failure of bonds that never yielded;
 we refer to this as 
\emph on
elastic damage
\emph default
.
 Damage to yielded bonds represents 
\emph on
plastic damage
\emph default
.
 The mechanism of damage and the failure measure may be different for these two types of bonds,
 particularly since a stress- or energy-based failure measure may not be appropriate for plastic damage.
 Intact bonds belong to the 
\begin_inset Formula $s-$
\end_inset

generation which is present at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Once yielding occurs,
 all successive generations of that family are labeled as yielded bonds 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 This distinction is necessary so we can then distinguish between damage to intact bonds (elastic damage) and damage to yielded bonds (plastic damage),
 since intact bonds which get damaged never have the ability to yield.
 It is important to note that the nature of the plastic deformation described in Section

 Damage modifies the material behavior by reducing the fraction of bonds in various generations,
 which scales the response accordingly.

\begin_layout Standard
In a reactive constrained mixture framework the insertion of damage into the reactive plasticity formulation is straightforward.
 Since bonds break permanently in a damage reaction,
 there is no need to define a function of state

 Furthermore,
 the specific free energy of broken bonds is zero.

Theoretical Formulation

\begin_layout Standard
We first briefly sketch the structure of the elastoplastic damage theory in FEBio for a single bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Since each bond family in reactive plasticity yields all at once,
 we can easily split an elastoplastic damage theory into two parts to represent elastic and plastic damage regimes.
 Assume that the first yielding reaction for bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 occurs at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=u_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Prior to this initial yielding,
 the damage behavior described in Section

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 applies,
 and the material composition is generally a mixture of intact (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=s$
\end_inset

) and broken (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=b$
\end_inset

) bonds satisfying the reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\beta}^{s}\to\mathcal{E}_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding bond mass fractions satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $1=w_{\beta}^{s}+w_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{y}=0$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{b}=F^{e}\left(\Xi_{\beta}^{e}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the elastic damage in bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=u_{\beta}$
\end_inset

,
 the remaining intact bonds 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{s}=1-w_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

 all yield,
 following the reaction in eq.

 The family mass balance is then given as 
\begin_inset Formula $1=w_{\beta}^{y}+w_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{s}=0$
\end_inset

 after yielding.
 The mass fraction of broken bonds 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{b}=\sum_{\beta}w_{\beta}w_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the elastic damage variable 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 as defined in classical damage mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For time 
\begin_inset Formula $t>u_{\beta}$
\end_inset

,
 yielded bonds may continue to yield,
 but they may also sustain damage according to the reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{\beta}^{y}\to\mathcal{E}_{\beta}^{b}$
\end_inset

,
 which reduces their mass fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\beta}^{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Damage to yielded bonds may occur based on a function of state (often described as a plastic strain,
 though it is not an observable kinematic variable),
 which is distinct from the measure of elastic damage.
 Therefore,
 we denote the 
\shape italic
plastic damage measure
\shape default

\begin_inset Formula $\Xi^{p}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $F^{p}\left(\Xi_{\beta}^{p}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 share the same functional forms for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi^{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{p}$

 For each bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

,
 only the remaining undamaged fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1-F^{p}\left(\Xi_{\beta}^{p}\right)$
\end_inset

 of yielded bonds may break and reform as the next yielded generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modern understanding is that plastic strain is ill-defined and not a suitable state variable.
 It must be recognized that,
 just as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}$
\end_inset

 is a constitutively-prescribed function of state and does not carry the meaning of a plastic deformation gradient,
 the plastic damage measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi^{p}\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}\right)$
\end_inset

 is also a function of state.
 This quantity is called a plastic strain for convenience only.
\end_layout

For elastic damage,

 the von Mises stress);
 this implies that the functions

\begin_inset Formula $\Xi^{p}$

 For yielded bonds in a bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 we can use the constitutively-determined mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}$

 to define plastic right Cauchy-Green and Lagrange strain tensors through
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{C}_{\beta}^{ys} & =\left(\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}\right)^{T}\cdot\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}\\

One possible constitutive relation for

 is to set it equal to the

\end_inset

In a numerical implementation,
 the effective plastic strain 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}^{p}$

 of the first bond family to yield may be reported as the effective plastic strain in the entire material,
 for consistency with plastic strain measures in classical models of plasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantities in this section do not represent plastic strains or plastic strain tensors,
 though we adopt the terminology due to similarities.
 Recall that the non-observable function of state 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}=\mathbf{F}_{\beta}^{ys}\left(\mathbf{F}^{s},\rho_{r\beta}^{\alpha}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a time-invariant mapping providing the reference configuration of a yielded bond 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 with respect to the reference configuration of the master constituent 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 for family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 The quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}_{\beta}^{ys}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}_{\beta}^{ys}$
\end_inset

 then also represent non-observable functions of state calculated as strain tensors.
 Consequently,
 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\beta}^{p}$

 is a measure of the relative motion of the reference configuration of bond family

\end_inset

 ,
 expressed as a scalar

 Physically,
 this amounts to the modeling assumption that once the breaking-and-reforming process takes a bond family out of a local neighborhood centered about its original position,
 the bond begins to degrade with further breaking-and-reforming processes.
 That each of these quantities exists for every bond family 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 emphasizes the lack of any true or unique plastic strain measure in this framework.

\end_inset

 at which the fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1-e^{-1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 (unitless) controls the slope of the response,

\end_inset

 approaches a step function with a jump at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Xi=\kappa$

 Therefore,

The most common family of constitutive relations employed for viscous fluids,

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

 respectively,
 the dynamic shear and bulk viscosity coefficients (both positive),
 which may generally depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and,
 for non-Newtonian fluids,
 on invariants of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 In practice,
 most constitutive models for non-Newtonian viscous fluids only use a dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\gamma}=\sqrt{2\mathbf{D}:\mathbf{D}}$

\end_inset

The term containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 is the only one that does not exhibit major symmetry.
 In Newtonian fluids,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

\end_inset

 are independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $J=1$
\end_inset

 remains constant and

 Thus,
 for both of these cases the term containing

\begin_layout Standard
The first term in the internal work becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}=J\cdot\mathbf{F}^{-1}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{F}^{-T}$

 is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress for the solid material.
 In general,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 (and thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

) is only a function of the solid strain,
 such as the right Cauchy-Green tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{F}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 or the Green-Lagrange strain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}=\left(\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{I}\right)/2$

\begin_inset Formula

 the linearization of

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}D\mathbf{S}\left[\Delta\mathbf{u}\right] & =\frac{\partial\mathbf{S}}{\partial\mathbf{E}}:D\mathbf{E}\left[\Delta\mathbf{u}\right]\\

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{C}}$
\end_inset

 Now,
 the linearization of the first term in

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\begin{aligned} & D\left(\int_{B}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{S}:\Grad\delta\mathbf{v}\,dV\right)\left[\Delta\mathbf{u}\right]\\

\begin{equation}
\rho\dot{\varepsilon}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\mathbf{D}\,,\label{eq:edy-energy-balance}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is the specific internal energy and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 is the rate of deformation tensor.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=\psi+\theta\eta$

\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=0$

 in elasticity (due to the temperature remaining constant),
 the above energy balance may be combined with the mass balance 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our time integration scheme,
 to satisfy energy balance,
 this equation needs to be evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n+\alpha_{f}}$

However,
 the solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\equiv\boldsymbol{\sigma}\left(\mathbf{F}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\right)$

 Thus,
 to satisfy energy balance over consecutive time steps,
 we want to evaluate an effective stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{n+\alpha_{f}}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{n+\alpha_{f}}\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}=\frac{\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n+1}-\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n}}{\Delta t}\,.\label{eq:edy-energy-discretized}

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{n+\alpha_{f}}$
\end_inset

 we follow the procedure of Gonzalez

 Substituting this relation,

 into the previous equation,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 produces
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f=\left(\frac{\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n+1}-\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n}}{J_{n+\alpha_{f}}^{s}\Delta t}-\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\right)\frac{1}{\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}}\,.\label{eq:edy-eff-stress-f}

 the equation for an effective stress needed to satisfy energy balance between consecutive time steps is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{n+\alpha_{f}}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n+\alpha_{f}}+\left(\frac{\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n+1}-\left(\Psi_{r}\right)_{n}}{J_{n+\alpha_{f}}\Delta t}-\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\right)\frac{\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}}{\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}}}\,.\label{eq:edy-eff-stress-final}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the limit when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}:\mathbf{D}_{n+\alpha_{f}}=0$
\end_inset

,
 we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{n+\alpha_{f}}=\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n+\alpha_{f}}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that this scheme produces conservation of linear and angular momentum and total energy only with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\infty}=1$
\end_inset

,
 or equivalently,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{f}=\alpha_{m}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1$
\end_inset

 Therefore,
 this effective stress calculation is only applied when the user employs 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\infty}=1$

 Note that

 At a subsequent time

 Alternatively,
 we may choose to write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Note from these relations that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\Theta$

 Thus,

 the Cayley transform must be used to enforce conservation of momentum and energy in a midpoint rule discretization scheme,
 whenever the rigid body is connected to a deformable body,

 Comparing the above expression to the exponential map

 using

Using the Cayley transform for illustration,
 the linearization of

In practice,
 it is convenient to store

 recognizing that
\begin_inset Formula

 is the unit vector along 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\left\Vert \boldsymbol{\theta}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 Thus,
 it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2\tan^{-1}\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\mathbf{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $\theta\mathbf{n}$

In the linearization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

,
 the contributions from the rate of change of linear momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{p}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}$

 reduce to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}D\dot{\mathbf{p}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\mathbf{r}\right] & =\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\beta\Delta t^{2}}m\Delta\mathbf{r}\\
D\dot{\mathbf{p}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\right] & =\mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
\,.
\]

\end_inset

To evaluate the contributions from the rate of change of angular momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}$
\end_inset

,
 we start from 
\begin_inset Formula $D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}=\alpha_{m}D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 it becomes necessary to transform the variables to the material frame,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+1} & =\boldsymbol{\omega}_{n+1}\times\mathbf{h}_{n+1}+\mathbf{J}_{n+1}\cdot\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{n+1}\\
 & =\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{n+1}\cdot\left(\hat{\mathbf{W}}_{n+1}\cdot\mathbf{J}_{r}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{n+1}+\mathbf{J}_{r}\cdot\mathbf{A}_{n+1}\right)
\end{aligned}
\,.

\end_inset

It follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\mathbf{r}\right]=\mathbf{0}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Then,
 using the relations in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Newmark-Integration-RBD"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\Theta}\right]=\alpha_{m}\left[\frac{1}{\beta\Delta t}\left(\left(\gamma\hat{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{n+1}+\frac{1}{\Delta t}\mathbf{I}\right)\cdot\mathbf{J}_{n+1}-\gamma\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{n+1}\right)\cdot\mathbf{T}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)-\hat{\dot{\mathbf{h}}}_{n+1}\right]\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\equiv\alpha_{m}\mathbf{K}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Alternatively,
 we may use the discretization in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:ga-momenta-Newmark"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 to produce
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\Theta}\right]=\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\gamma\Delta t}D\mathbf{h}_{n+1}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\Theta}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\mathbf{h}_{n+1}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\Theta}\right]=\left(\frac{\gamma}{\beta\Delta t}\mathbf{J}_{n+1}\cdot\mathbf{T}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)-\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{n+1}\right)\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\Theta}\right]=\frac{\alpha_{m}}{\Delta t}\left(\frac{1}{\beta\Delta t}\mathbf{J}_{n+1}\cdot\mathbf{T}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)-\frac{1}{\gamma}\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{n+1}\right)\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}\equiv\alpha_{m}\mathbf{K}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}
\]

\end_inset

Therefore,
 the contribution to 
\begin_inset Formula $D\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 from the linear and angular momenta produces a stiffness matrix called the mass matrix,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\mathbf{p}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}\\
\dot{\mathbf{h}}_{n+\alpha_{m}}
\end{array}\right]=\alpha_{m}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{m}{\beta\Delta t^{2}}\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{0}\\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{K}

 & \equiv\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{n+\alpha_{f}}\cdot\mathbf{Z}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}$
\end_inset

 is the moment arm in the reference configuration.
 Note that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

This section summarizes the theoretical developments of the two body contact problem.
 After introducing some notation and terminology,
 the contact integral is presented,
 which contains the contribution to the virtual work equation from the contact tractions.
 Since the nonlinear contact problem is solved using a Newton based iterative method,
 the contact integral is linearized.
 Next,
 anticipating a finite element implementation,
 the contact integral and its linearization are discretized using a standard finite element approach.
 Finally the augmented Lagrangian method for enforcing the contact constraints is described.

 The integration can be approximated using a quadrature rule,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 are the number of integration points for element 
\begin_inset Formula $e$

 It is now assumed that the integration points coincide with the element's nodes (e.g.
 for a quadrilateral surface element we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}_{1}=\left(-1,-1\right)$

 we have

As of FEBio version 1.2,
 two alternative formulations for sliding contact are available.
 The first method,
 which is referred to as the

 is very similar to the formulation described above.
 It only differs in that it uses a Gaussian quadrature rule instead of nodal integration.
 Because of the more accurate integration rule,
 it was noted that this method in many situations was more stable and resulted in better convergence.

 The contribution of contact to the external virtual work may be written as

 as it deforms over time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
 in terms of contravariant surface parametric coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(i)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 These covariant basis vectors are tangent to

 and it follows that the unit outward normal to

\begin_inset Formula

 the elemental area on

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}da^{(i)} & =J_{\eta}^{(i)}\,d\eta_{(i)}^{1}d\eta_{(i)}^{2}\,, & J_{\eta}^{(i)} & =\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}^{(i)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{(i)}\right|\,.\end{aligned}

Therefore the contact integral of eq.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\eta}^{(1)}$

 and integration is performed over points 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 with prescribed parametric coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(1)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\eta}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 represents a material frame,
 it is possible to linearize 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G_{c}$
\end_inset

 by applying the directional derivative operator directly to the integrand,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\delta G_{c}=\int_{\Gamma_{\eta}^{(1)}}D\left(\begin{bmatrix}\delta\mathbf{v}^{(1)} & \delta\mathbf{v}^{(2)}\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{t}^{(1)}\\

\end{bmatrix}\,J_{\eta}^{(1)}\right)d\eta_{(1)}^{1}d\eta_{(1)}^{2}\,,\label{eq:dgc}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Df\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{2}Df\left[\Delta\mathbf{u}^{(i)}\right]\,.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To proceed with this linearization,
 it is necessary to formulate the kinematics of points on

\end_inset

 and provide expressions for the contact traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 that can differentiate between frictional stick and slip.

 describe searching for evolving contact and are only valid during slip.
 In stick no relative motion occurs between contacting points,
 thus the intersection point 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 does not evolve during the iterative solution process,
 allowing the development of kinematics of sticking contact.
 Implicit in this condition is the assumption that the contact projection was previously resolved,
 and thus contact searching is not performed again;
 rather,
 the contact point on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 is given by the parametric coordinates of intersection 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(2)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 found from the previous time point,
 which will be denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(2)p}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

,
 with the subscripted 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 referring to the previous time.
 Thus,
 we write the spatial position of 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 in stick as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{s}^{(2)}=\mathbf{x}^{(2)}\left(\eta_{(2)p}^{\alpha},t\right)=\mathbf{x}^{(1)}\left(\eta_{(1)}^{\alpha},t\right)+\mathbf{g}_{s}\,,\label{eq:stick_x2}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 is a vectorial gap function,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{s}=\mathbf{x}_{s}^{(2)}-\mathbf{x}^{(1)}\,.\label{eq:stick_gap}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the vectorial distance,
 at the current time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
 between material points which were in contact at the previous time step;
 for perfect stick we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{s}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 In a finite element implementation however,
 it is important to note that the intersection point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{s}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 is not in general the point that would be found from a ray directed from 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(1)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 along the unit outward normal 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because stick will not be enforced exactly,
 so the points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{s}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 will separate slightly when using a penalty method for enforcing this constraint.
 How to minimize this separation and enforce perfect stick behavior is the subject of the forthcoming sections.

 the total velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\eta}_{(2)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 are the contravariant components of the convective velocity of material passing through this intersection point.
 In effect,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\eta}_{(2)}^{\alpha}\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{(2)}$

 represents the relative (slip) velocity between the material on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 and that on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

 Importantly,
 as noted below when performing time discretization and linearization,

In contrast,
 this presentation proposes to treat stick and slip separately,
 controlled by an exact return mapping based on the slip criterion.
 The return mapping defines a rule for correcting a calculated traction which exceeds the slip limit and is thus not permissible.
 Stick will be treated as a special case of a tied interface,
 whereas in slip the traction will be directly prescribed.
 The formulation of Coulomb frictional contact is presented for both penalty and augmented Lagrangian regularization schemes.

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the vectorial Lagrange multiplier in stick.
 In slip,
 we first calculate the normal component of the contact traction by augmenting the normal gap

 The total traction vector in slip is then defined to be

 In this approach the Lagrange multiplier

 augments the traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{(1)}$

 in stick,
 but in slip only the normal component of traction 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$

 is augmented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$

 and the tangential traction is directly prescribed from the augmented normal component.
 This approach has the advantage of preserving an exact mapping to the proper tangential traction in slip,
 which is consistent with the augmented normal traction.
 As in the penalty case,
 a trial state and return map controlled by the slip criterion is employed to differentiate between stick and slip,

The Lagrange multipliers 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}$
\end_inset

 are held constant during each Newton step.
 Outside of the Newton loop,
 in this study we propose a novel update scheme where one of these multipliers is considered active and is updated from the kinematic data (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

),
 and the other is considered passive and is derived from the active multiplier.
 The contact status is determined via eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 If the current status is stick (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi<0$
\end_inset

),
 we update 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}$
\end_inset

 (active) and derive 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 (passive),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s} & \leftarrow\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}+\varepsilon\mathbf{g}_{s}\\
\lambda_{n} & =\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}\cdot\mathbf{n}^{(1)}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:AL-stick}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Alternatively,
 if the current contact status is slip (
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=0$
\end_inset

),
 we update 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 (active) and derive 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}$
\end_inset

 (passive),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\lambda_{n} & \leftarrow\lambda_{n}+\varepsilon g\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s} & =\lambda_{n}\left(\mathbf{n}^{(1)}+\mu\mathbf{s}^{(1)}\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:AL-slip}

\end_inset

An active-passive strategy for the multipliers ensures consistency when the contact status switches between stick and slip and is made possible due to this formulation's use of a single penalty parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

,
 in conjunction with an exact return mapping for slip.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Augmentations proceed until a tolerance related to a convergence criterion is met.
 In this formulation,
 two separate convergence criteria and their associated tolerances are defined.
 The first criterion considers the relative change of the norms of the active Lagrange multipliers between successive iterations,
 where the associated unitless tolerance 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{tol}$
\end_inset

 specifies the largest allowable change.
 Convergence is achieved when
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{L^{r}-L^{r-1}}{L^{r}}\right|<P_{tol}\,,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{r}$
\end_inset

 represents the total norm of the active multipliers across the contact surface at augmentation step 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

,
 calculated by summing all the individual norms,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{r}=\sum_{e=1}^{n_{e}^{(1)}}\sum_{k=1}^{n_{int}^{(e)}}l_{k,e}^{r}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this expression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{e}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is the number of element faces on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(1)}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{int}^{(e)}$
\end_inset

 is the number of integration points on the 
\begin_inset Formula $e\text{th}$
\end_inset

 element face,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{k,e}^{r}$
\end_inset

 is the norm of the active Lagrange multiplier at the 
\begin_inset Formula $k\text{th}$
\end_inset

 integration point on the 
\begin_inset Formula $e\text{th}$
\end_inset

 element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 at augmentation step 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

,
 defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
l_{k,e}^{r}=\begin{cases}
\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}^{r}\cdot\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}^{r} & \Phi<0,\quad\text{sticking}\\
\left(\lambda_{n}^{r}\right)^{2} & \Phi=0,\quad\text{slipping}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The second criterion is a gap tolerance,
 where augmentations will continue until the magnitude of the gap is lower than the specified tolerance 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{tol}$
\end_inset

 at every location.
 Convergence of the augmentations requires
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{max}\,\left(\left|\mathbf{g}_{s}\right|,\left|g\right|\right)<G_{tol}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{g}_{s}\right|$
\end_inset

 is associated with points currently sticking and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|g\right|$
\end_inset

 with those in slip.
 The tolerance 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{tol}$
\end_inset

 has units of length,
 allowing enforcement of the non-penetration and stick constraints to arbitrarily small precision.

\begin_layout Standard
Determination of whether stick or slip is active is accomplished by a trial state and return map,
 and follows the same procedure for both penalty and augmented Lagrangian regularizations.
 We begin by calculating a trial traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 assuming stick,
 utilizing either eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 or eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The trial normal and tangential components 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_{T}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 are evaluated from 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 and inserted into the slip criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Phi=\left|\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_{T}^{(1)}\right|-\mu\left|\tilde{t}_{n}\right|.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Based on the slip criterion and trial traction vector,
 we perform a return mapping and obtain the traction vector as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{t}^{(1)}=\begin{cases}
\tilde{\mathbf{t}}^{(1)} & \Phi<0\,,\quad\text{sticking}\\
t_{n}(\mathbf{n}^{(1)}+\mu\mathbf{s}^{(1)}) & \Phi=0\,,\quad\text{slipping}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 is given by either eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

nolink "false"

\end_inset

 or eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:AL_tn"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of first contact,
 a trial stick traction cannot be calculated,
 as stick requires a previous intersection point.
 Consequently,
 first contact is treated as a case of slip in this framework.
 The alternative of treating first contact as frictionless is unsatisfying,
 as the lack of friction at the first iteration can lead to premature failure and thus precludes the modeling of certain problems that rely on frictional forces for stability (such as load-control analyses).
 After one iteration,
 the traction can be evaluated via the return map described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computationally,
 care must be taken to ensure that augmentation does not unnecessarily change the stick-slip status.
 For normal contact,
 the update 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}\leftarrow\lambda_{n}+\varepsilon g$
\end_inset

 will augment the normal traction until the non-penetration contact constraint is adequately satisfied,
 with no adverse consequence if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 slightly overshoots the final target value during an intermediate augmentation.
 For tangential contact however,
 augmentation of the tangential traction that overshoots the final target value may cross the boundary between stick and slip,
 thus changing the nature of the solution.
 For example,
 at the first augmentation step,
 the stick traction is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{(1)}=\varepsilon\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 and the multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}$
\end_inset

 is augmented from its initial zero value to 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}=\varepsilon\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 according to eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:AL-stick"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 at the start of the next iteration,
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 has not yet changed,
 the traction is calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{(1)}=\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{s}+\varepsilon\mathbf{g}_{s}=2\varepsilon\mathbf{g}_{s}$
\end_inset

 according to eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:AL_stick_traction"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 which essentially counts the gap function twice and can in some cases shift the contact from stick to slip.
 To circumvent potential error introduced by this step,
 our implementation freezes the stick-slip status until the completion of the first iteration following an augmentation step.
 After the first iteration,
 the gap function has been reduced by the augmentation and the traction is split appropriately between the remaining gap and the multiplier.
 In this way,
 the double-counting of the gap function does not unnecessarily shift the contact status,
 but augmentation is able to modify the stick-slip status if accurate enforcement of the contact constraints requires it.

 In the present formulation,
 this simplification to perfect contact is not adopted,

\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$

 For the contact traction,
 this work implements a Coulomb-like framework for frictional contact

 In this framework the relationship between sticking and slipping,
 and thus the contact traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 on the opposing surfaces,
 is described by a slip criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 where on the primary surface
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Psi=\left|\mathbf{t}_{T}^{(1)}\right|-\mu_{\text{eff}}\left|t_{n}\right|

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{eff}}=\mu_{\text{eq}}\left[1+\left(1-\varphi\right)\frac{p}{t_{n}}\right]\label{eq:mueff-biphasic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}=\mathbf{t}^{(1)}\cdot\mathbf{n}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is the normal component of the contact traction (negative in compression),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{T}^{(1)}=\mathbf{t}^{(1)}-t_{n}\mathbf{n}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is the tangential component of the contact traction,
 and the effective friction coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\text{eff}}$
\end_inset

 is given by eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 with no distinction made between static and kinetic coefficients of friction.
 The user-defined parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\text{eq}}$
\end_inset

 represents the friction coefficient when the fluid pressure has subsided (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

),
 whereas the user-defined parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 represents the fraction of the apparent contact area where solid-on-solid contact takes place 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $-p/t_{n}$
\end_inset

 represents the local fluid load support at each point on the contact surface.
 Since the friction coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\text{eff}}$
\end_inset

 cannot be negative,
 the theoretical upper bound on the local fluid load support is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.-p/t_{n}\right|_{\max}=\left(1-\varphi\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

 This upper bound is enforced whenever numerical errors produce a greater value of the local fluid load support.

 this work treats stick and slip separately,
 controlled by an exact return mapping predicated on the value of the slip criterion.
 The return mapping defines a rule for correcting a calculated stick traction which exceeds the slip limit and is thus not permissible.
 Stick is treated as a special case of a tied biphasic interface (Section

Coulomb's law of kinetic friction requires that the friction force be aligned with the relative slip velocity between the two surfaces.
 Despite the name,
 Coulomb's law is a constitutive relation,
 and hence must obey the Principle of Material-Frame Indifference;
 this requires a frame-invariant relative velocity.
 As points in stick do not experience relative motion,
 the development of velocities below is only concerned with opposing contact points in slip.

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{(1)}^{\alpha}$

 different material points

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}^{(2)}\left(\eta_{(2)}^{\alpha},t\right)=\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}^{(2)}\left(\eta_{(2)}^{\alpha},t\right)}{\partial t}+\dot{\eta}_{(2)}^{\alpha}\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{(2)}\label{eq:v2}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathbf{x}^{(2)}/\partial t$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(2)}$

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\eta}_{(2)}^{\alpha}$

 are the contravariant components of the convective velocity of material passing through the intersection point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{(2)}$

 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\eta}_{(2)}^{\alpha}\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 represents the relative slip velocity between the material on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 and that on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{(1)}$

 Importantly,
 by definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathbf{x}^{(2)}/\partial t$

 requires directional derivatives of kinematic quantities,
 some of which depend on the stick-slip status.
 To simplify the presentation,
 the continuum linearization is presented only for a few select quantities.
 The remainder of the linearization is deferred until after discretization,
 as many expressions are much easier to manipulate in discretized form.
 To keep the equations more manageable,
 the discretization of slip is split into frictionless and frictional terms,
 and the final form of the stiffness matrices follows this split.
 The full model is easily obtained by summing the frictionless and frictional contributions.
 Here we emphasize that,

In the current implementation,
 only frictionless contact is taken into consideration,
 so that the contact traction has only a normal component,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\left(i\right)}=t_{n}\mathbf{n}^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 To evaluate and linearize 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G_{c}$

 define the covariant basis vectors on each surface as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}}{\partial\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}},\quad\alpha=1,2,\label{eq626}

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 represent the parametric coordinates of that point.
 The unit outward normal on each surface is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{n}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}\right|}.\label{eq627}

Now the contact integral may be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta G_{c} & =\int_{\gamma^{\left(1\right)}}\left(\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(1\right)}-\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(2\right)}\right)t_{n}\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(1\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(1\right)}\,d\eta_{\left(1\right)}^{1}d\eta_{\left(1\right)}^{2}\\

Tied Contact

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some situations it is useful to connect two non-conforming meshes together.
 This can be done by defining a tied contact interface.
 In FEBio,
 the tied contact works very similar to the sliding contact interface.
 We need to define a slave surface and a master surface,
 where it is assumed that the slave surface nodes will be tied to the master surface faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gap Function
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Tied-Gap-Function"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as in sliding contact,
 we need to define a gap function that measures the distance between the slave and master surface.
 In order to do that,
 we first define the projection of a slave node to the master surface.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\bar{Y}}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)=\arg\min\limits_{\mathbf{Y}\in\Gamma^{\left(2\right)}}\left\Vert \mathbf{X}-\mathbf{Y}\right\Vert \,.\label{eq679}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This definition is similar to that of the sliding interface,
 except that now the projection is done in the material reference frame.
 This implies that the projection only needs to be calculated once,
 at the beginning of the analysis.
 We can now proceed to the definition of the gap function.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)=\boldsymbol{\varphi}^{\left(1\right)}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)-\boldsymbol{\varphi}^{\left(2\right)}\left(\mathbf{\bar{Y}}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\right)\,.\label{eq680}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

An important observation is that the gap function is now a vector quantity since the gap needs to be closed in all direction,
 not just the normal direction as is the case in sliding contact.

With the definition of the gap function at hand (equation

 we can define the contribution to the virtual work equation from the tied contact reaction forces.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\int\limits_{\Gamma_{c}}\mathbf{T}\cdot\delta\mathbf{g}\,d\Gamma\,.\label{eq681}

Here,

is the reaction force that enforces the constraint

 Since we anticipate the use of an augmented Lagrangian formalism,
 we can write this reaction force as follows,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{T}=\boldsymbol{\lambda}+\varepsilon\mathbf{g}\,.\label{eq682}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The contact integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq681"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 can be discretized as follows.
 First,
 we split the integration over all the slave surface elements.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\sum\limits_{e=1}^{nel}\int\limits_{\Gamma_{c}^{\left(e\right)}}\mathbf{T}\cdot\delta\mathbf{g}\,d\Gamma^{\left(e\right)}\,.\label{eq686}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The integration can be approximated by a quadrature rule,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\sum\limits_{e=1}^{nel}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{int}^{\left(e\right)}}w^{i}j\left(\xi_{i}\right)\mathbf{T}\left(\xi_{i}\right)\cdot\delta\mathbf{g}\left(\xi_{i}\right)\,.\label{eq687}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If we use a nodally integrated elements,
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{w}^{\left(1\right)}\left(\xi_{i}\right) & =\mathbf{c}_{i}^{\left(1\right)}\,,\\
\mathbf{w}^{\left(2\right)}\left(\xi_{i}\right) & =\sum\limits_{j}N_{j}\left(\bar{\xi}_{i}\right)\mathbf{c}_{j}^{\left(2\right)}\,,
\end{aligned}
\label{eq688}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\mathbf{g}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\mathbf{c}_{i}^{\left(1\right)}-\sum\limits_{j}N_{j}\left(\bar{\xi}_{i}\right)\mathbf{c}_{j}^{\left(2\right)}\,.\label{eq689}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We can now write the contact integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq686"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 in its final form,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{t}=\sum\limits_{e=1}^{nel}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{int}^{\left(e\right)}}w^{i}j\left(\xi_{i}\right)\left(\mathbf{N}\left(\xi_{i}\right)\mathbf{T}\left(\xi_{i}\right)\right)\cdot\delta\boldsymbol{\Phi}\,,\label{eq690}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
\mathbf{c}_{i}^{\left(1\right)} & \mathbf{c}_{1}^{\left(2\right)} & \mathbf{c}_{2}^{\left(2\right)} & \cdots & \mathbf{c}_{n}^{\left(2\right)}\end{array}\right]\,,\label{eq691}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{N}\left(\xi_{i}\right)=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{I} & -\mathbf{N}_{1} & \cdots & -\mathbf{N}_{n}\end{array}\right]\,,\label{eq692}

\begin_inset Formula

0 & N_{i} & 0\\
0 & 0 & N_{i}

\end_inset

For the linearized tied contact integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 a similar discretization procedure leads to,
 
\begin_inset Formula

 Due to continuity requirements on the traction and fluxes,

 and solvent fluxes 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}^{\left(i\right)}$

 may be combined into the contact integral 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta G_{c} & =\int_{\gamma^{\left(1\right)}}\left(\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(1\right)}-\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(2\right)}\right)\cdot\mathbf{t}^{\left(1\right)}da^{\left(1\right)}\\

\end{aligned}
\label{eq696}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To evaluate and linearize 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G_{c}$
\end_inset

,
 define the covariant basis vectors on each surface as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}}{\partial\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}},\quad\alpha=1,2,\label{eq697}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

 represents the spatial position of points on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 represent the parametric coordinates of that point.
 The unit outward normal on each surface is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{n}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}\right|}\,.\label{eq698}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now the contact integral may be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta G_{c} & =\int_{\gamma^{\left(1\right)}}\left(\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(1\right)}-\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(2\right)}\right)\cdot\mathbf{t}\,\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(1\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(1\right)}\right|\,d\eta_{\left(1\right)}^{1}d\eta_{\left(1\right)}^{2}\\

 define the covariant basis vectors on each surface as

The premise of a tied interface is that the parametric coordinates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 are both invariants (i.e.,
 they are determined in the reference configuration and remain unchanged over time).
 The parametric coordinates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the integration points on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

,
 and those of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}$

 by shooting a ray from the integration point on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

 to intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from this premise that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}D\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)} & =\Delta\mathbf{u}^{\left(i\right)} & D\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(i\right)} & =\mathbf{0}\\

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(1\right)}$

 continuity of effective fluid pressure and solute concentration,
 as well as normal fluid and solute fluxes,
 will only be enforced within the contact interface;

 ambient conditions are not set automatically on regions of

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 where a solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$

 Therefore,
 these regions naturally enforce zero fluid and solute flux (impermeable boundary),

 and

 are the velocity of,

 respectively.
 A tied fluid interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 which allows fluid to cross 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
 must enforce these continuity requirements.
 For fluid analyses,
 we let
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{\sigma}=-p\mathbf{I}+\boldsymbol{\tau}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the fluid pressure and

\end_inset

 is the viscous shear stress.

 neglecting the contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}$

 relative to that of

 and making use of the jump condition from mass balance in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we find that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\left[\psi+\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{u}^{\Gamma}\cdot\mathbf{u}^{\Gamma}\right]\right]=0\,.\label{eq:jump-energy-redux}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 are functions of state that only depend on the fluid volume ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 (in an isothermal analysis,
 see eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 letting 
\begin_inset Formula $J$

 be continuous across

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is continuous across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

;
 thus,
 from eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:mass-balance-integrated"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{\Gamma}\cdot\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is continuous,
 hence eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:jump-energy-redux"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 is satisfied.
 In other words,
 letting 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[J\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to satisfy the jump conditions from mass and energy balance,
 as long as we also enforce 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{u}^{\Gamma}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

.
 For a viscous fluid,
 we also assume that the no-slip condition holds,
 implying that our jump requirement for the fluid velocity is even more stringent,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{u}^{\Gamma}\right]\right]=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 (or equivalently,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{v}\right]\right]=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

).
 According to the above relations between the stress and pressure,
 and recognizing that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[J\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[p\right]\right]=0$
\end_inset

,
 we may also simplify the linear momentum jump condition of eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:jump-linear-momentum"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\boldsymbol{\tau}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 the jump conditions that we need to enforce for a tied fluid interface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\left[\left[J\right]\right] & =0\\
\left[\left[\mathbf{v}\right]\right] & =\mathbf{0}\\
\left[\left[\boldsymbol{\tau}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma} & =\mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
\,.\label{eq:jump-tied-fluid}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These jump conditions are consistent with the choice of nodal degrees of freedom for fluid analyses (namely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

).
 On a tied (or sliding) fluid interface,
 we don't have continuity of the mesh,
 therefore we can only enforce continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 by enforcing continuity of the fluid pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and viscous traction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}^{\tau}\equiv\boldsymbol{\tau}\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 in our fluid finite element formulation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is not a natural boundary condition since it is calculated directly from 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

.
 Instead,
 as explained in Section

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the natural boundary condition for the fluid dilatation governing equation is continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\left[\mathbf{v}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma}=0$

 Due to continuity requirements on the viscous traction and normal fluid velocity,
 the external virtual work resulting from tractions

\end_inset

 and normal velocities 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}^{\left(i\right)}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\delta G_{c} & =\int_{\gamma^{\left(1\right)}}\left(\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(1\right)}-\delta\mathbf{v}^{\left(2\right)}\right)\cdot\mathbf{t}^{\tau\left(1\right)}da^{\left(1\right)}\\
 & -\int_{\gamma^{\left(1\right)}}\left(\delta J^{\left(1\right)}-\delta J^{\left(2\right)}\right)v_{n}^{\left(1\right)}da^{\left(1\right)}\,.
\end{aligned}
\label{eq696-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To evaluate and linearize 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G_{c}$
\end_inset

,
 define the covariant basis vectors on each surface as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{g}_{\alpha}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}}{\partial\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}},\quad\alpha=1,2,\label{eq697-2}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

 represents the spatial position of points on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\left(i\right)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 represent the parametric coordinates of that point.
 The unit outward normal on each surface is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{n}^{\left(i\right)}=\frac{\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{g}_{1}^{\left(i\right)}\times\mathbf{g}_{2}^{\left(i\right)}\right|}\,.\label{eq698-2}

\begin_inset Formula

 The penalty factor

Rigid body joints,
 such as spherical,
 revolute,
 prismatic,
 cylindrical and planar joints,
 are a special category of rigid connectors that have a large stiffness spring connecting the joint origins on each rigid body,
 in a manner that only allows relative motion along the joint translational degree(s) of freedom.
 Similarly,
 a large stiffness torsional spring connects the rigid bodies in a manner that only allows relative rotation along the joint rotational degree(s) of freedom.

 dampers,

 a joint may include a linear damper connecting its origins,

 Using the above relations for

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}^{\left(i\right)}$

 it reduces to
\begin_inset Formula

 where

th basis vector in the reference configuration.
 Thus,
 at any time

 As usual,

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}}\label{eq:jf-gap-function}

\end_inset

 is the (optional) Lagrange multiplier used when invoking the augmented Lagrangian method,

 is a penalty parameter that represents the spring stiffness.
 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}$
\end_inset

 is a projection that limits the reaction force to the directions that are not free to move.
 In general,
 there are three possible options for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}$

 If the constraint is enforced properly,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\left(1\right)}$

Prescribed Rotation at Joint
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative rotation between the rigid bodies is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q}=\boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{\left(2\right)}\cdot\boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{\left(1\right)T}=\sum_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{\left(2\right)}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}^{\left(1\right)}\,.\label{eq:prj-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We want it to be equal to a rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\chi}$
\end_inset

 as expressed in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}^{\left(1\right)}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}=\exp\left[\boldsymbol{\chi}\right]\,.\label{eq:prj-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We enforce this constraint by requiring that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{Q}^{T}=\mathbf{I}\,.\label{eq:prj-3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We may thus evaluate
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{Q}^{T}\,,\label{eq:prj-4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 when the constraint is enforced.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 because of the orthogonality of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is always orthogonal,
 even when the constraint is not enforced.
 The axial vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 may be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}=\exp\left[\boldsymbol{\xi}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 and the constraint is enforced when 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 a moment 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{r}\boldsymbol{\xi}$
\end_inset

 needs to be prescribed,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)}=\varepsilon_{r}\boldsymbol{\xi}\,.\label{eq:prj-5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal,
 we can linearize it along an increment 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\boldsymbol{\xi}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $D\mathbf{R}\left[\Delta\boldsymbol{\xi}\right]=\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}\cdot\mathbf{R}$
\end_inset

,
 from which it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}=D\mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{R}^{T}$
\end_inset

 with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{A}\cdot D\mathbf{Q}^{T}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\left(\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\left(1\right)}\cdot\mathbf{Q}^{T}-\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\left(2\right)}\right)\,,\label{eq:prj-6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\xi}}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\left(1\right)}\cdot\mathbf{A}^{T}-\mathbf{R}\cdot\Delta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{\left(2\right)}\cdot\mathbf{R}^{T}\,.\label{eq:prj-7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From this expression we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\boldsymbol{\xi}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(1\right)}-\mathbf{R}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(2\right)}\,.\label{eq:prj-8}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)}=\varepsilon_{r}\left(\mathbf{A}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(1\right)}-\mathbf{R}\cdot\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(2\right)}\right)\,.\label{eq:prj-9}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbf{K}_{mr}^{\left(1\right)}=\mathbf{K}_{mr}^{\left(2\right)}=\mathbf{0}}\,,\label{eq:prj-10}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\begin{aligned}\mathbf{K}_{m\theta}^{\left(1\right)} & =\varepsilon_{r}\mathbf{A}\\
\mathbf{K}_{m\theta}^{\left(2\right)} & =-\varepsilon_{r}\mathbf{R}

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a spring between points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

 on rigid bodies 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The spring force is oriented along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

,
 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{n}=\frac{\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}\right|}\,.\label{eq:rbs-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We may write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=\left|\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}\right|\,,\quad L_{0}=\left|\mathbf{X}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{X}^{\left(2\right)}\right|\,.\label{eq:rbs-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then,
 the spring force acting on body 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}=k\left(L-L_{0}\right)\mathbf{n}=k\left(\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}-L_{0}\mathbf{n}\right)\,,\label{eq:rbs-3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the spring constant.
 It is understood that the special case 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}=k\left(\mathbf{x}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}^{\left(1\right)}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We do not need to use the augmented Lagrangian method here,
 therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}=k\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

,
 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}-L_{0}\frac{\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}\right|}\,.\label{eq:rbs-4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the spring may freely pivot about its insertion point,
 we let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\begin{aligned}\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)} & =k\left(\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}-L_{0}\frac{\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}}{\left|\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}-\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}\right|}\right)\\
\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)} & =\mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:rbs-5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the virtual work associated with this spring is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta G=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(1\right)} & \delta\boldsymbol{\omega}^{\left(1\right)} & \delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(2\right)} & \delta\boldsymbol{\omega}^{\left(2\right)}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}\\
\hat{\mathbf{z}}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(1\right)}\cdot\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}\\
-\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}\\
-\hat{\mathbf{z}}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}\cdot\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq:rbs-6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The linearization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G$
\end_inset

 may be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-D\delta G=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(1\right)} & \delta\boldsymbol{\omega}^{\left(1\right)} & \delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(2\right)} & \delta\boldsymbol{\omega}^{\left(2\right)}\end{array}\right]\left[\mathbf{K}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\Delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(1\right)}\\
\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(1\right)}\\
\Delta\mathbf{r}^{\left(2\right)}\\
\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\left(2\right)}
\end{array}\right]\,,\label{eq:rbs-7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the stiffness matrix is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathbf{K}\right]=k\alpha\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{P} & -\mathbf{P}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_{n+1}^{\left(1\right)} & -\mathbf{P} & \mathbf{P}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_{n+1}^{\left(2\right)}\\

\end_inset

This relative velocity is related to the rigid body degrees of freedom by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{x}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(i\right)} & =\mathbf{r}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(i\right)}+\mathbf{z}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(i\right)}\\

\end_inset

Since the dashpot may freely rotate about its insertion points,
 we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)}=\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

\mathbf{m}^{\left(1\right)} & =\mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
}\,,\label{eq:rbd-4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the virtual work resulting from the dashpot is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta G=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}

-\hat{\mathbf{z}}_{n+\alpha}^{\left(2\right)}\cdot\mathbf{f}^{\left(1\right)}
\end{array}\right]\,.\label{eq:rbd-5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The linearization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta G$
\end_inset

 may be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 we may augment this expression by using 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{p}=\left(\lambda+\varepsilon f\right)\delta f$

The penalty method with augmented Lagrangian does not increase the number of equations that need to be solved globally.
 However,
 it does require users to specify the parameter

Method of Lagrange Multipliers
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the method of Lagrange multipliers we have to include equations that solve for the multipliers.
 We let the work done by the constraint be represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{c}=\lambda f$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the multiplier (if 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a vector equation,
 we can use 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{c}=\boldsymbol{\lambda}\cdot\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

).
 The total work is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{W}=W+W_{c}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is the work of the unconstrained problem (i.e.
 the contributions from the internal and external forces.) Then,
 we evaulate the first varition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\widetilde{W}=\delta W+\delta W_{c}=0$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{c}=\delta f+\delta\lambda\,f$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta f$
\end_inset

 is given as per eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{c}$
\end_inset

 may be written in matrix form as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta W_{c}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\delta x_{1} & \cdots & \delta x_{n} & \delta\lambda\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\lambda\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots\\
\lambda\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}\\
f
\end{array}\right]=\delta\boldsymbol{r\cdot}\mathbf{f}_{c}\,.\label{eq:nlc-lm-virtual-work}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The linearization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta W_{c}$
\end_inset

 along increments 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

 takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\delta W_{c}=\sum_{i}\delta x_{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\Delta\lambda+\sum_{i}\delta x_{i}\sum_{j}\lambda\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}\Delta x_{j}+\delta\lambda\,\sum_{j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}\Delta x_{j}\,.\label{eq:nlc-lm-linearization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The corresponding stiffness matrix is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\delta W_{c}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\delta x_{1} & \cdots & \delta x_{n} & \delta\lambda\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\lambda\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{1}^{2}} & \cdots & \lambda\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{1}\partial x_{n}} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
\lambda\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{n}\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \lambda\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{n}^{2}} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}} & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\Delta x_{1}\\
\vdots\\
\Delta x_{n}\\
\Delta\lambda
\end{array}\right]=\delta\boldsymbol{r\cdot}\mathbf{K}_{c}\boldsymbol{\Delta r}\,,\label{eq:nlc-lm-stiffness}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This resulting system of equations requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to part of the solution,
 and to be updated at each iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 according to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{\left(k+1\right)}\leftarrow\lambda^{\left(k\right)}+\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The stiffness matrix is symmetric for this analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of Lagrange multipliers increases the number of equations that need to be solved globally.
 However,
 it does not require users to specify additional parameters.
 Note that the contribution to the stiffness matrix introduces a zero coefficient on the diagonal of the stiffness matrix for the equation corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 This means that these equations can only be solved with linear solvers that support pivoting.
 (Most linear solvers in FEBio,
 including the default pardiso solver,
 can handle zero-diagonal elements.)

For linear constraints of the form
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}=a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and second derivatives are all zero,
 so that the contributions to the global residual and stiffness matrix take the form
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Chapter
Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter describes the theoretical framework of FEBio's optimization module.
 This module can be used to optimize model parameters (like material parameters,
 or load values) in order to achieve an objective.
 The objective is generally the minimization of the 
\emph on
objective function
\emph default
,
 to be introduced below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Objective Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective function,
 which is to be minimized,
 can be defined as follows,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi\left(\mathbf{a}\right)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i}-f\left(x_{i};\mathbf{a}\right)\right]^{2}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{i},y_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 are user-defined data pairs and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x;\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the function that extracts the corresponding data from the model.
 The optimization module tries to find the model parameters 
\series bold
a
\series default
 that minimize the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 It does this by repeatedly evaluating the function 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
 which will usually call FEBio to solve a forward FE problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Levenberg-Marquardt Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the methods that is currently implemented in FEBio's optimization method is the constrained Levenberg-Marquardt method via the 
\emph on
levmar 
\emph default

 (see

 for more information on this library.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Levenberg-Marquardt method is a numerical algorithm that minimizes a function that is defined as a sum of squares of nonlinear functions,
 i.e.
 the objective function as defined above.
 It combines the steepest-descent method with a Gauss-Newton method to find the parameters that minimize the objective function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LM method requires a set of measured values 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i},y_{i})$
\end_inset

 and an initial guess for the 
\series bold
a
\series default
 vector.
 It then tries to find a better estimate for 
\series bold
a 
\series default
by replacing it with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}+\delta$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i};\mathbf{a}+\delta)$
\end_inset

 is linearly approximated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x_{i};\mathbf{a}+\delta\right)\approx f\left(x_{i};\mathbf{a}\right)+\mathbf{J}_{i}\delta
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{J}_{i}$
\end_inset

is the Jacobian of 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset


\emph default
 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
 Substituting this in the objective function and minimizing with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 leads to,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\mathbf{J^{\mathrm{T}}J\mathrm{)\delta=}J^{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{a}))}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\series bold
y
\series default
 is the vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i},$
\end_inset

and 
\series bold
f
\series default
 is the vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i};\boldsymbol{a})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main idea of the LM method is to replace this linear equation with the following.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\mathbf{J^{\mathrm{T}}J\mathrm{+\mu(\mathbf{J}^{\mathrm{T}}\mathbf{J})_{\mathit{ii}})\delta=}J^{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{a}))}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

is a damping parameter that is controlled by the algorithm.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

is small,
 the method approximates Gauss-Newton,
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

is large it is closer to a steepdest-descent method.
 The algorithm will modify try to modify 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

such that an improvement to the parameter vector 
\series bold
a
\series default
 can be found in each iteration.
 The method will terminate when the value of the objective function falls below a user-specified tolerance (the 
\emph on
obj_tol
\emph default
 parameter in FEBio).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evaluation of the Jacobian requires evaluating the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\series bold
a
\series default
.
 These derivatives are approximated via forward difference formulas.
 For example,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th component of the gradient is approximated as follows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial a_{k}}\approx\frac{1}{\delta a_{k}}\left[f\left(a_{1},\cdots,a_{k}+\delta a_{k},\cdots,a_{m}\right)-f\left(a_{1},\cdots,a_{k},\cdots,a_{m}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

The value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta a_{k}$
\end_inset

is determined from the following formula.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta a_{k}=\varepsilon\left(1+a_{k}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is the forward difference scale factor (the 
\shape italic

\shape default
option in FEBio).
 In FEBio,
 the initial value for the damping parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

can be set with the

\begin_layout Standard
The sum of two tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}+\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 and defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\left(\mathbf{T}+\mathbf{S}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{a}}\label{eq9-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}+\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is also a tensor,
 whose components are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mathbf{T}+\mathbf{S}\right)_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbf{T}+\mathbf{S}\right)\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}=\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}+\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}=T_{ij}+S_{ij}

Dyadic Product of Vectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dyadic product of two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{ab}$
\end_inset

) and defined as the transformation which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{c}=\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{c}\right)\mathbf{a}}\label{eq10-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 For any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

,
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{gathered}\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\left(\alpha\mathbf{c}+\beta\mathbf{d}\right)=\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\left(\alpha\mathbf{c}+\beta\mathbf{d}\right)\right)\mathbf{a}=\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\alpha\mathbf{c}\right)\mathbf{a}+\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\beta\mathbf{d}\right)\mathbf{a}\\
=\alpha\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{c}\right)\mathbf{a}+\beta\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{d}\right)\mathbf{a}=\alpha\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{c}+\beta\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{d}
\end{gathered}
\]

\end_inset

 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is a tensor.
 Its Cartesian components with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}=\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)\mathbf{a}=b_{j}\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{a}=a_{i}b_{j}
\]

\end_inset

 In matrix form,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1}b_{1} & a_{1}b_{2} & a_{1}b_{3}\\
a_{2}b_{1} & a_{2}b_{2} & a_{2}b_{3}\\
a_{3}b_{1} & a_{3}b_{2} & a_{3}b_{3}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
a_{1}\\
a_{2}\\
a_{3}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
b_{1} & b_{2} & b_{3}\end{array}\right]=\left[\mathbf{a}\right]\left[\mathbf{b}\right]^{T}
\]

\end_inset

 Note that in general,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\ne\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 the dyadic product is 
\shape italic
not commutative
\shape default
.
 Also note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{1}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right],\quad\left[\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{2}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right],\quad\left[\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{3}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]\quad\text{etc.}
\]

\end_inset

thus it is possible to represent a second-order tensor in terms of its Cartesian components in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}=T_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{1}+T_{12}\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{2}+T_{13}\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{3}+\ldots+T_{33}\mathbf{e}_{3}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

,
 or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbf{T}=T_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}}\label{eq11-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This turns out to be an important result that can be generalized to higher order tensors,
 e.g.,
 third-order tensors can be represented in terms of their Cartesian components as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}=T_{ijk}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

,
 and similarly for higher orders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
The scaling transformation derived in a previous example can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{T}=s_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{1}+s_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{2}+s_{3}\mathbf{e}_{3}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{3}
\]

Trace of a Second-Order Tensor

 is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxed{\tr\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}}
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxed{\tr\left(\alpha\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}+\beta\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{d}\right)=\alpha\tr\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)+\beta\tr\left(\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{d}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The trace operator yields a scalar function.
 In component form,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tr\left(a_{i}b_{j}\right)=a_{i}b_{i}
\]

\end_inset

 For any tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

,
 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}=T_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tr\mathbf{T}=T_{ij}\tr\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)=T_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}=T_{ij}\delta_{ij}=T_{ii}=T_{11}+T_{22}+T_{33}
\]

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Subsection
Orthogonal Tensor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An orthogonal tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 is a linear transformation which preserves the length of a vector and the angle between vectors.
 Thus,
 by definition,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right|=\left|\mathbf{a}\right|\quad\text{and}\quad\cos\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{a},\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)=\cos\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 for any vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from this definition and the definition of the dot product of vectors (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\left|\mathbf{a}\right|\left|\mathbf{b}\right|\cos\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right))$
\end_inset

,
 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}
\]

\end_inset

 But 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)=\mathbf{b}\cdot\left(\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{Q}\right)\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

,
 which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\cdot\left(\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{I}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary,
 an orthogonal tensor must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

.
 In indicial form,
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{im}^{T}Q_{mj}=Q_{mi}Q_{mj}=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

,
 and in matrix form,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{Q}\right]^{T}\left[\mathbf{Q}\right]=\left[\mathbf{I}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{T}=\mathbf{Q}^{-1}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 the transpose of an orthogonal tensor is equal to its inverse,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{Q}^{-1}=\mathbf{I}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbf{Q}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{Q}^{T}=\mathbf{I}}\label{eq21-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The determinant of an orthogonal tensor is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\mathbf{Q}=\left(\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{1}\times\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\cdot\mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{3}=\left(\mathbf{e}'_{1}\times\mathbf{e}'_{2}\right)\cdot\mathbf{e}'_{3}=\pm\mathbf{e}'_{3}\cdot\mathbf{e}'_{3}=\pm1
\]

\end_inset

 Here,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}'_{1},\mathbf{e}'_{2},\mathbf{e}'_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the orthonormal basis resulting from the transformation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 maintains the handedness of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (e.g.,
 if both 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}'_{1},\mathbf{e}'_{2},\mathbf{e}'_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 form a right-handed basis),
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathbf{Q}=+1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 is called a

proper

 orthogonal transformation (also equivalent to a rigid body rotation).
 Otherwise,
 in the case of a reflection which reverses the handedness of the basis vectors,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\mathbf{Q}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}$
\end_inset

 is called

When two of the eigenvalues are repeated (a double root of the characteristic equation),
 the resulting eigenvectors are not necessarily orthogonal to each other;
 however,
 they remain orthogonal to the third eigenvector.
 This means that any vector lying in the plane normal to the third eigenvector is an eigenvector corresponding to the double root.
 Similarly,
 when all three eigenvalues are repeated (a triple root),
 any vector becomes an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$

 In this case,
 
\begin_inset Formula $-p$

 Any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{v}=-p\mathbf{v}$

\begin_layout Standard
In continuum mechanics the eigenvectors

\begin_inset Formula

Thus,
 we can always find a set of three orthonormal eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{n}_{1},\mathbf{n}_{2},\mathbf{n}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 for any real symmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$

 Given a tensor

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\lambda_{3}$
\end_inset

 and eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{1},\mathbf{n}_{2},\mathbf{n}_{3}$
\end_inset

,
 the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 in the orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{n}_{1},\mathbf{n}_{2},\mathbf{n}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{i1}=\mathbf{v}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{1}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{n}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{1}=\lambda_{1}\delta_{i1}\quad T_{i2}=\lambda_{2}\delta_{i2}T_{i3}=\lambda_{3}\delta_{i3}

\end_inset

 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathbf{T}\right]_{\mathbf{n}_{i}}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}

0 & T_{2} & 0\\

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}=T_{ij}\mathbf{n}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{j}=T_{i1}\mathbf{n}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{1}+T_{i2}\mathbf{n}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{2}+T_{i3}\mathbf{n}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{3}$
\end_inset

 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{T}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{n}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{1}+\lambda_{2}\mathbf{n}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{2}+\lambda_{3}\mathbf{n}_{3}\otimes\mathbf{n}_{3}\label{eq:eigen-spectral-rep}

\begin_layout Subsection
Third-Order Tensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}$
\end_inset

 is a linear transformation that transforms any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 into a second-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{S}}\label{eq62-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In general,
 the dyadic product of three vectors is a third-order tensor which satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{c}\right)\cdot\left(\alpha\mathbf{u}+\beta\mathbf{v}\right)=\left(\alpha\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{u}+\beta\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{v}\right)\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)}\quad\forall\,\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\,.\label{eq62b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Any third-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in terms of its Cartesian components 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ijk}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathbb{T}=T_{ijk}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}}\label{eq62d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the Cartesian components of a third-order tensor may be evaluated from
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{T_{ijk}=\mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot\left(\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{k}\right)\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}}\label{eq62c}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows from Eqs.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{a}=T_{ijk}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=T_{ijk}\left(\mathbf{e}_{k}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)=T_{ijk}a_{k}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)=\mathbf{S}=S_{ij}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the indicial form of eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq62-1"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{ijk}a_{k}=S_{ij}\label{eq62e}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{k}=T_{ijk}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\label{eq62f}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The double dot product of a third-order tensor with a second-order tensor is defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxed{\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{c}\right):\left(\mathbf{d}\otimes\mathbf{e}\right)=\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{d}\right)\left(\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{e}\right)\mathbf{a}}\,,
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxed{\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right):\left(\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{d}\otimes\mathbf{e}\right)=\left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c}\right)\left(\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{d}\right)\mathbf{e}}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore,
 the double dot product of a third-order tensor with a second-order tensor is a vector given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{T}:\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)=\left(\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}\,.\label{eq63f}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Proof:
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{b}=T_{ijk}b_{k}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbb{T}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=T_{ijk}b_{k}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=T_{ijk}b_{k}\left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)\mathbf{e}_{i}=T_{ijk}a_{j}b_{k}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{T}:\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)=T_{ijk}\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\right):\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)=T_{ijk}\left(\mathbf{e}_{j}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\left(\mathbf{e}_{k}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\mathbf{e}_{i}=T_{ijk}a_{j}b_{k}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 thus completing the proof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any second-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

,
 it also follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{T}:\mathbf{S}=T_{ijk}S_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{i}\,.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
If we introduce the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}$
\end_inset

 as the third-order (pseudo-)tensor of Cartesian components 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ijk}$
\end_inset

,
 the relation between an antisymmetric tensor and its dual vector can also be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\boldsymbol{\Omega}=-\mathbb{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\omega}}\label{eq26b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\boldsymbol{\omega}=-\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}:\boldsymbol{\Omega}}\label{eq27b}
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dyadic product of four vectors is a fourth-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

,
 defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{d}\right)\cdot\mathbf{v}=\left(\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{v}\right)\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{c}\right)\label{eq:63g}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Cartesian components of a fourth-order tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{ijkl}=\left(\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\right):\mathcal{T}:\left(\mathbf{e}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{l}\right)\label{eq:63h}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}=T_{ijkl}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{l}\label{eq:63i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore,
 a fourth-order tensor transforms a vector into a third-order tensor,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathbf{a}=\left(T_{ijkl}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{l}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=T_{ijkl}a_{l}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\equiv S_{ijk}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}=\mathbb{S}\label{eq:63j}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The double dot product of a fourth-order tensor with a second-order tensor is a second-order tensor defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mathcal{T}:\left(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}\right)=\left(\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}}\label{eq:63k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

from which it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}:\mathbf{S}=T_{ijmn}S_{mn}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}\label{eq:63l}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or equivalently,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathcal{T}:\mathbf{S}\right)_{ij}=T_{ijkl}S_{kl}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fourth-order tensor can exhibit three levels of symmetry,
 which can be represented using Cartesian components as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}T_{ijkl} & =T_{jikl} & \text{left minor symmetry}\\
T_{ijkl} & =T_{ijlk} & \text{right minor symmetry}\\
T_{ijkl} & =T_{klij} & \text{major symmetry}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:tens4-symmetries}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Whereas a general fourth-order tensor may have 81 distinct components,
 a tensor with one minor symmetry has 54 distinct components;
 a tensor with both minor symmetries has 36 distinct components;
 and a tensor with minor and major symmetries has 21distinct components.
 We may represent the major symmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}^{T}$
\end_inset

,
 whose Cartesian representation is provided above.
 It follows from this definition that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{S}:\mathcal{T} & =\mathcal{T}^{T}:\mathbf{S}\\
\left(\mathbf{S}:\mathcal{T}\right)_{ij} & =S_{kl}T_{klij}=T_{ijkl}^{T}S_{kl}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin_layout Subsection
Additional Tensor Products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier we saw that the dyadic product of vectors can produce tensors.
 Similarly,
 we can define dyadic products of tensors which produce higher-order tensors.
 In particular,
 the following products of second-order tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 produce fouth-order tensors,
 satisfying
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\left(\mathbf{A}\otimes\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{S} & =\left(\mathbf{B}:\mathbf{S}\right)\mathbf{A}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\oslash\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{S} & =\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{T}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\obslash\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{S} & =\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{S}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{T}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\odot\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{S} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{A}\oslash\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{A}\obslash\mathbf{B}\right):\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{T}+\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{S}^{T}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{T}\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:tensor-products}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is any second-order tensor.
 Using Cartesian components of tensors,
 the indicial form of these tensor products are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\left(\mathbf{A}\otimes\mathbf{B}\right)_{ijkl} & =A_{ij}B_{kl}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\oslash\mathbf{B}\right)_{ijkl} & =A_{ik}B_{jl}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\obslash\mathbf{B}\right)_{ijkl} & =A_{il}B_{jk}\\
\left(\mathbf{A}\odot\mathbf{B}\right)_{ijkl} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{ik}B_{jl}+A_{il}B_{jk}\right)
\end{aligned}
